 Do you want to feel really safe at home? VR3000 is another friend to help you fight viruses and bacteria. Just add the appropriate disinfectant to the water tank and start the robot. Your floors will be perfectly clean and disinfected. 
 He's not afraid of anything 
 Nothing can stop him. Dusts but also wipes. It cleans any surface, except for carpets up to 1.5 cm high. It's so quiet it won't bother you. A large 600 ml tank is used for vacuuming. There is a turbo brush in the central body that will clean not only the hair, but also fine dust. Together with the side brushes, it perfectly sucks garbage from corners of the room. If you want to wipe the floor, replace the trash can with a 370ml water tank with a cleaning cloth. You can wash the cloth in the washing machine, and if you wear out the fabric or brushes, a free replacement box is included. 
 Gyroscopic navigation 
 Gyro navigation allows you to vacuum almost the entire floor area. Achieves up to 98% coverage of tiled floors. It provides excellent orientation in space, and thus reduces cleaning time. It also prevents you from working in the same place. Thanks to the application, you can control which places have been cleaned. 
 Control 
 The robot can be controlled using the We Back application, which is available in English and is free for iOS and Android. You can control it from anywhere and at any time, just select the appropriate program. You can also control the vacuum cleaner with Alexa or Google Home voice assistant. And if you're not a fan of the app or don't have a smartphone, you can control the robot with the LED display or remote control.

Efficient BLDC motor 
 The high suction power is mainly due to the BLDC brushless motor which has many advantages. The motor is quieter, more reliable, more energy efficient and more durable than ordinary motors. 
 Environmentally friendly 
 This elegant device can be classified as environmentally friendly. It recognizes when it's cleaned and automatically switches to standby before switching to the next job program. Thus, it saves the Li-Ion battery and extends its life. 
 5 cleaning modes 
 You can choose up to 5 cleaning modes or schedule a deferred cleaning. In TURBO mode, it will demonstrate its incredible cleaning power. AUTO SMART effectively cleans the entire space. Circuit mode provides cleaning along the wall and circular mode only where needed. There is also a quick 30 minute cleanup. 
 Smarter than it seems 
 Don't be afraid of the robot working near stairs or other obstacles. It can overcome obstacles up to 1.5 cm high, so you don't have to worry about thresholds between rooms. It is only 7.5 cm tall, so it can clean surfaces, e.g. under a cupboard or bed. It has anti-impact and anti-fall function. After detecting a low battery level, it automatically finds the charging station, where it waits for further cleaning.

 He's not afraid of anything 
 Nothing can stop him. Dusts but also wipes. It cleans any surface, except for carpets up to 1.5 cm high. It's so quiet it won't bother you. A large 600 ml tank is used for vacuuming. There is a turbo brush in the central body that will clean not only the hair, but also fine dust. Together with the side brushes, it perfectly sucks garbage from corners of the room. If you want to wipe the floor, replace the trash can with a 370ml water tank with a cleaning cloth. You can wash the cloth in the washing machine, and if you wear out the fabric or brushes, a free replacement box is included. 
 Gyroscopic navigation 
 Gyro navigation allows you to vacuum almost the entire floor area. Achieves up to 98% coverage of tiled floors. It provides excellent orientation in space, and thus reduces cleaning time. It also prevents you from working in the same place. Thanks to the application, you can control which places have been cleaned. 
 Control 
 The robot can be controlled using the We Back application, which is available in English and is free for iOS and Android. You can control it from anywhere and at any time, just select the appropriate program. You can also control the vacuum cleaner with Alexa or Google Home voice assistant. And if you're not a fan of the app or don't have a smartphone, you can control the robot with the LED display or remote control.

Efficient BLDC motor 
 The high suction power is mainly due to the BLDC brushless motor which has many advantages. The motor is quieter, more reliable, more energy efficient and more durable than ordinary motors.

Circuit mode provides cleaning along the wall and circular mode only where needed. There is also a quick 30 minute cleanup. 
 Smarter than it seems 
 Don't be afraid of the robot working near stairs or other obstacles. It can overcome obstacles up to 1.5 cm high, so you don't have to worry about thresholds between rooms. It is only 7.5 cm tall, so it can clean surfaces, e.g. under a cupboard or bed. It has anti-impact and anti-fall function.

 Excessive humidity in our homes causes not only material damage, but can also threaten our health. High humidity is an ideal environment for mold growth that can cause health complications such as sinusitis, bronchitis or other respiratory diseases. If there is mold in your apartment or basement, there is likely to be high humidity. At values ​​above 50%, the dehumidifier is the perfect helper that protects not only your health, but also your property. 
 Drying modes 
 The OV2000 dehumidifier is suitable for rooms up to 120 m2. You can choose one of four drying modes. Silent mode is ideal if you are going to sleep in the room, you can set the humidity in this case from 35 to 80% in five steps. The so-called ""dry"" mode will be used especially when drying clothes, drying cabinets or small areas where the air flows to the maximum. You can also choose either continuous or automatic mode. In automatic mode, the humidity is set to 55%. 
 Large volume 
 In one day it can condense up to 20 liters of water. In this way, you can use it not only at home, but also in indoor pools or conservatories. After filling a large - 5, 5 l container, the device will turn off automatically. You do not have to drain water from the device, just connect the hose. Wheels allow easy operation, thanks to which the device can easily be moved from room to room.

Clean Air 
 The ""AIR CLEAN"" button is used to start the air cleaning mode. The fan is turning and the compressor is not working. The OV2000 dehumidifier also has an outlet for the dried air. You simply set the flap and the air is evenly distributed throughout the room. 
 Ionization 
 Our dehumidifier is two devices. It can dry and clean the air in one step, because it represents both a purifier and a dryer. Ionization is another very important function of the purifier. The air is ionized by means of an electric discharge, increases the amount of ions in the air that help to clean them. Their number has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, better concentration, increased efficiency, and especially helps fight headaches. 
 Moisture indicator 
 The indicator shows orange, green or red. The color changes depending on the humidity change in the room. When the humidity drops below 50%, the light turns orange. The green color will glow when the humidity is about 50-70%. The last red color indicates humidity exceeding 70%.

With the CA3000 air purifier with humidifier, you can remove contaminants from the room that arise in households or in the environment. It has 8 air cleaning speeds and an efficiency of 488 m3 / h. It is quiet, easy to move and suitable for rooms up to 60 m2. Thanks to its modern design, it does not disturb the interior. Equipped with a timer that can be set for up to 12 hours and a practical child-proof lock. It will help relieve the symptoms of allergies, chronic and acute diseases of the respiratory tract, heart and blood vessels. It removes dust, various types of allergens, bacteria, viruses, odors, smog and other dangerous substances from the air. Give yourself and your family a better, healthier atmosphere.
7-stage filtration
Filtration is the most important cleaning process that determines air quality. The CA3000 is equipped with a 7-stage filter system to trap impurities and prevent them from spreading. It can remove up to 99.9% of air pollutants. Each individual filter layer captures certain types of pollutants, and by working together, you get perfectly clean air in your home. Thanks to advanced technology, the device monitors the current status of the filters and reminds you to replace them.
Air quality sensor
The air purifier is equipped with a pollution sensor that allows you to see in real time the dust (PM2.5) floating in the air in the room. Once started, it works in fully automatic mode so you don't have to worry about anything. It reads the current status independently and sets the optimal cleaning speed according to the recognized values. The exact value is shown on the easy-to-read LED display. You can visually check the air quality with a colored backlight that changes depending on the degree of pollution: Green = excellent air quality (up to 80 PM2.5) • Blue = light pollution (81 - 120 PM2.5) • Yellow = medium pollution (121 - 160 PM2.5) • red = heavily polluted (161 PM2.5 and more)
Humidifier
The CA3000 air purifier also has an air humidifier function. Your home gets rid of uncomfortable dry air, which increases the risk of respiratory illnesses, exacerbates allergies and asthma, and can contribute to overall fatigue. Simply fill the humidifier container with water, turn on the device to instantly increase the humidity in the room and maintain a healthier breathing environment. It reaches a maximum capacity of 86 ml / h. One filling is enough for 54 hours of humidification.
Concept home mobile application
You can control the air purifier from anywhere with the Concept Home mobile app, which is available free of charge for iOS and Android. Thanks to this, you can remotely switch the device on or off, adjust the cleaning speed, check the condition of the filters or, for example, the current air condition in the room. And if you're not a fan of the app, you can control it with the remote control or the buttons right on the display.
Quality sleep
Clean air also affects the quality of sleep, which is why the air purifier is equipped with a night mode. When it is dark, the CA3000 automatically switches to SMART mode (you can also set it manually using the SLEEP button). The air purifier then works quietly, only 30 dB, and the display with its colored background lighting goes out. So you can enjoy clean air while sleeping without any obstacles. In the morning you wake up refreshed and relaxed.
Filter properties
Dust filter - captures coarse air pollutants such as dust particles, hair, animal hair, pollen and other.
Catalytic filter - elliminates  ammonia, benzene and other dangerous substances that can be released from new furniture and carpets, for example.
Carbon filter - absorbs toxic, asphyxiating gases and vapors of various origins such as formaldehyde (released from new floors, furniture or building materials), benzene or cigarette smoke.
Antibacterial filter - eliminates bacteria and prevents mold from forming.
HEPA filter 13 - captures particles from 0.1 micrometers with an efficiency of 99.9% (dust, pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, allergens, mold spores, etc.).
UV lamp and ionizer
Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and absorbs odors. The ionizer uses an electrical discharge to increase the amount of negatively charged ions in the air (known as air vitamins) that improve overall air quality. Their quantity has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, concentration, efficiency and the fight against headaches. At the same time, the ionizer absorbs positively charged dust particles, viruses, bacteria and removes cigarette smoke. Both functions can be carried out independently of one another.
Do you really want to feel safe at home? CA3000 is another part of a range of helpers that help keep the home cleaner and healthier. Thanks to an efficient filter system, up to 99.9% of bacteria, viruses and allergens are removed from the air.
What is PM2.5?
These are particles in the air with a maximum diameter of 2.5 microns. To illustrate, these are particles that are on average up to 28 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair and 36 times smaller than a grain of sand. Inhaling them can have adverse effects on human health.

In the morning you wake up refreshed and relaxed.
Filter properties
Dust filter - captures coarse air pollutants such as dust particles, hair, animal hair, pollen and other.
Catalytic filter - elliminates  ammonia, benzene and other dangerous substances that can be released from new furniture and carpets, for example.
Carbon filter - absorbs toxic, asphyxiating gases and vapors of various origins such as formaldehyde (released from new floors, furniture or building materials), benzene or cigarette smoke.
Antibacterial filter - eliminates bacteria and prevents mold from forming.
HEPA filter 13 - captures particles from 0.1 micrometers with an efficiency of 99.9% (dust, pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, allergens, mold spores, etc.).
UV lamp and ionizer
Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and absorbs odors. The ionizer uses an electrical discharge to increase the amount of negatively charged ions in the air (known as air vitamins) that improve overall air quality. Their quantity has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, concentration, efficiency and the fight against headaches. At the same time, the ionizer absorbs positively charged dust particles, viruses, bacteria and removes cigarette smoke. Both functions can be carried out independently of one another.
Do you really want to feel safe at home? CA3000 is another part of a range of helpers that help keep the home cleaner and healthier. Thanks to an efficient filter system, up to 99.9% of bacteria, viruses and allergens are removed from the air.
What is PM2.5?
These are particles in the air with a maximum diameter of 2.5 microns. To illustrate, these are particles that are on average up to 28 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair and 36 times smaller than a grain of sand. Inhaling them can have adverse effects on human health.

It is equipped with an eye protection sensor and offers 5 levels of intensity, 2 modes and a lifespan of 300,000 pulses.
 Long-lasting smooth skin
 Do you want smooth and beautiful skin? With the Concept IL3000 Perfect Skin IPL epilator, you can achieve this in the comfort of your own home. The IL3000 uses Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) technology, which has undergone more than 15 years of clinical research around the world. It allows treatment in 2 modes and 5 levels depending on skin tone. With its help, you can easily remove hair from the legs, hands and sensitive areas of the bikini, armpits and face (cheeks, upper lip, chin). The device is easy to use and its depilation is painless and long-lasting. The life of the epilator reaches 300,000 light pulses.
 IPL technology
 This scientifically proven technology provides fast and lasting results. During epilation, flashes of intense pulses reach the surface of the skin, where they act on the dark pigment of the hair. This effect effectively and painlessly damages the hair, even at the roots, and prevents it from growing back. With regular and correct use, you will get smooth skin for up to several months.
 Don't wait for summer
 If you want beautiful and smooth skin in summer, start epilating well in advance, as the skin must not be exposed to sunlight for at least 4 weeks before and at least 2 weeks after using the IPL epilator. If you have applied a self-tanning cream to your skin, wait until the tan has completely disappeared. The IPL epilator can be used by both men and women over the age of 18.

Who is the IPL epilator for?
 Epilation with an IPL epilator is most effective for people with lighter skin and darker hair that contains dark pigment. The lighter and darker the hair, the less effective the IPL epilator.
 Proper use
 The skin you want to epilate must be clean, dry and shaved before using the IPL epilator. Choose the right level of light intensity for your skin type or according to the sensitivity of the area where the light will act. Press the epilator application area on the skin. When the button is pressed, the device emits a light pulse. In one treatment, avoid releasing more than one impulse on the same part of the skin. You may feel a slight warmth or tingling sensation during epilation, but it should never be painful. If you feel pain, it is necessary to reduce the intensity of radiation.
 Eye protection
 The IPL epilator has a built-in safety sensor that does not allow you to send an impulse when you point the epilator into the open. Thanks to this sensor, the device will only work properly when the application surface is in full contact with the skin.

 When not to use the IPL epilator
 The IPL epilator must not be used on tattooed body parts, areas with permanent makeup, freckles, birthmarks, or other dark marks. Cover these areas thoroughly before use. At the same time, IPL hair removal is not recommended for people with very sensitive skin, skin diseases, varicose veins and for pregnant and lactating women. If you are sick or simply unsure if IPL hair removal is right for you, consult your dermatologist or doctor.
 Mobile application
 Thanks to the Concept IPL mobile application, you get a personal advisor who will help you plan individual treatments and monitor the progress of treatment. It will help you choose the right level of light intensity for your skin tone and monitor the intervals between treatments. There is also a clear video tutorial on how to use the epilator correctly to achieve effective and long-lasting results.

It comes with 2 attachments and a safety sensor to protect your eyes. It offers 5 intensity levels, 2 modes and has a lifetime of 300,000 pulses.
Long-lasting smooth skin
Do you want smooth skin? With the Concept IL3020 Perfect Skin IPL Depilator, you can achieve it in the comfort of your own home. The IL3020 uses Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) technology, which has been through more than 15 years of clinical research around the world. It enables the treatment in 2 modes and 5 levels depending on the skin tone. It is equipped with 2 interchangeable attachments, with which you can easily remove hair from the legs, hands and sensitive areas of the bikini, armpits and face (cheeks, upper lip, chin). The device is easy to use and its depilation is painless and long-lasting. The lifetime of the Depilator reaches 300,000 light pulses.
IPL technology
This scientifically proven technology provides fast and lasting results. During epilation, flashes of intense pulses reach the surface of the skin, where they act on the dark pigment of the hair. This effect effectively and painlessly damages the hair, even at the roots, and prevents it from regrowth. With regular and correct use, you will get smooth skin for up to several months.
Don't wait for summer
If you want to have beautiful and smooth skin in summer, start Depilation well in advance as the skin must not be exposed to sunlight for at least 4 weeks before and at least 2 weeks after using the IPL epilator. If you have applied self-tanning cream to your skin, wait until the tan has completely disappeared. The IPL Depilator can be used by both men and women over 18 years of age.
Who is the IPL epilator for?
Depilation with the IPL epilator is most effective for people with lighter skin and darker hair that contains a dark pigment. The lighter the hair and the darker the skin type, the less effective the IPL epilator is.

Proper use
The skin you intend to depilate must be clean, dry and shaved before using the IPL depilator. Choose the right light intensity level for your skin type or depending on the sensitivity of the area where the light will act. Press the epilator application area against your skin. After pressing the button, the device emits a light pulse. Avoid releasing more than one impulse on the same part of the skin in one treatment. You may feel a slight warmth or tingling sensation while epilating, but it should never be painful. If you feel pain, it is necessary to reduce the intensity of the radiation.
Eye protection
The IPL depilator has a built-in safety sensor that prevents you from sending an impulse when you point the epilator out into an open space. Thanks to this sensor, the device will only work properly when the application surface is in full contact with the skin.
PRECISION mode
It is suitable for removing hair from the most inaccessible and sensitive areas such as the face, armpits, bikini area, etc. The device emits single pulses when the pulse trigger button is pressed.
GLISS mode
This mode is suitable for removing hair from larger areas such as legs, arms, back, etc. Slowly move the device over the skin without lifting it. The epilator emits smooth flashes in a row for faster and smoother treatments.
When not to use the IPL depilator
The IPL depilator must not be used on tattooed body parts, areas with permanent makeup, freckles, birthmarks, or other dark marks. Cover these areas thoroughly before use. At the same time, IPL hair removal is not recommended for people with very sensitive skin, skin diseases, varicose veins and for pregnant and lactating women. If you are sick or simply unsure if IPL hair removal is right for you, consult your dermatologist or doctor.

With the CA3000 air purifier with humidifier, you can remove contaminants from the room that arise in households or in the environment. It has 8 air cleaning speeds and an efficiency of 488 m3 / h. It is quiet, easy to move and suitable for rooms up to 60 m2. Thanks to its modern design, it does not disturb the interior. Equipped with a timer that can be set for up to 12 hours and a practical child-proof lock. It will help relieve the symptoms of allergies, chronic and acute diseases of the respiratory tract, heart and blood vessels. It removes dust, various types of allergens, bacteria, viruses, odors, smog and other dangerous substances from the air. Give yourself and your family a better, healthier atmosphere.
7-stage filtration
Filtration is the most important cleaning process that determines air quality. The CA3000 is equipped with a 7-stage filter system to trap impurities and prevent them from spreading. It can remove up to 99.9% of air pollutants. Each individual filter layer captures certain types of pollutants, and by working together, you get perfectly clean air in your home. Thanks to advanced technology, the device monitors the current status of the filters and reminds you to replace them.
Air quality sensor
The air purifier is equipped with a pollution sensor that allows you to see in real time the dust (PM2.5) floating in the air in the room. Once started, it works in fully automatic mode so you don't have to worry about anything. It reads the current status independently and sets the optimal cleaning speed according to the recognized values. The exact value is shown on the easy-to-read LED display. You can visually check the air quality with a colored backlight that changes depending on the degree of pollution: Green = excellent air quality (up to 80 PM2.5) • Blue = light pollution (81 - 120 PM2.5) • Yellow = medium pollution (121 - 160 PM2.5) • red = heavily polluted (161 PM2.5 and more)
Humidifier
The CA3000 air purifier also has an air humidifier function. Your home gets rid of uncomfortable dry air, which increases the risk of respiratory illnesses, exacerbates allergies and asthma, and can contribute to overall fatigue. Simply fill the humidifier container with water, turn on the device to instantly increase the humidity in the room and maintain a healthier breathing environment. It reaches a maximum capacity of 86 ml / h. One filling is enough for 54 hours of humidification.
Concept home mobile application
You can control the air purifier from anywhere with the Concept Home mobile app, which is available free of charge for iOS and Android. Thanks to this, you can remotely switch the device on or off, adjust the cleaning speed, check the condition of the filters or, for example, the current air condition in the room. And if you're not a fan of the app, you can control it with the remote control or the buttons right on the display.
Quality sleep
Clean air also affects the quality of sleep, which is why the air purifier is equipped with a night mode. When it is dark, the CA3000 automatically switches to SMART mode (you can also set it manually using the SLEEP button). The air purifier then works quietly, only 30 dB, and the display with its colored background lighting goes out. So you can enjoy clean air while sleeping without any obstacles. In the morning you wake up refreshed and relaxed.
Filter properties
Dust filter - captures coarse air pollutants such as dust particles, hair, animal hair, pollen and other.
Catalytic filter - elliminates  ammonia, benzene and other dangerous substances that can be released from new furniture and carpets, for example.
Carbon filter - absorbs toxic, asphyxiating gases and vapors of various origins such as formaldehyde (released from new floors, furniture or building materials), benzene or cigarette smoke.
Antibacterial filter - eliminates bacteria and prevents mold from forming.
HEPA filter 13 - captures particles from 0.1 micrometers with an efficiency of 99.9% (dust, pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, allergens, mold spores, etc.).
UV lamp and ionizer
Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and absorbs odors. The ionizer uses an electrical discharge to increase the amount of negatively charged ions in the air (known as air vitamins) that improve overall air quality. Their quantity has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, concentration, efficiency and the fight against headaches. At the same time, the ionizer absorbs positively charged dust particles, viruses, bacteria and removes cigarette smoke. Both functions can be carried out independently of one another.
Do you really want to feel safe at home? CA3000 is another part of a range of helpers that help keep the home cleaner and healthier. Thanks to an efficient filter system, up to 99.9% of bacteria, viruses and allergens are removed from the air.
What is PM2.5?
These are particles in the air with a maximum diameter of 2.5 microns. To illustrate, these are particles that are on average up to 28 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair and 36 times smaller than a grain of sand. Inhaling them can have adverse effects on human health.

 Excessive humidity in our homes causes not only material damage, but can also threaten our health. High humidity is an ideal environment for mold growth that can cause health complications such as sinusitis, bronchitis or other respiratory diseases. If there is mold in your apartment or basement, there is likely to be high humidity. At values ​​above 50%, the dehumidifier is the perfect helper that protects not only your health, but also your property. 
 Drying modes 
 The OV2000 dehumidifier is suitable for rooms up to 120 m2. You can choose one of four drying modes. Silent mode is ideal if you are going to sleep in the room, you can set the humidity in this case from 35 to 80% in five steps. The so-called ""dry"" mode will be used especially when drying clothes, drying cabinets or small areas where the air flows to the maximum. You can also choose either continuous or automatic mode. In automatic mode, the humidity is set to 55%. 
 Large volume 
 In one day it can condense up to 20 liters of water. In this way, you can use it not only at home, but also in indoor pools or conservatories. After filling a large - 5, 5 l container, the device will turn off automatically. You do not have to drain water from the device, just connect the hose. Wheels allow easy operation, thanks to which the device can easily be moved from room to room.

Clean Air 
 The ""AIR CLEAN"" button is used to start the air cleaning mode. The fan is turning and the compressor is not working. The OV2000 dehumidifier also has an outlet for the dried air. You simply set the flap and the air is evenly distributed throughout the room. 
 Ionization 
 Our dehumidifier is two devices. It can dry and clean the air in one step, because it represents both a purifier and a dryer. Ionization is another very important function of the purifier. The air is ionized by means of an electric discharge, increases the amount of ions in the air that help to clean them. Their number has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, better concentration, increased efficiency, and especially helps fight headaches. 
 Moisture indicator 
 The indicator shows orange, green or red. The color changes depending on the humidity change in the room. When the humidity drops below 50%, the light turns orange. The green color will glow when the humidity is about 50-70%. The last red color indicates humidity exceeding 70%.

The rest of the data is automatically sent via Bluetooth to the mobile application, which processes, evaluates and saves it. Thanks to history, you can monitor your progress, evaluate the effectiveness of exercise, set new goals and, for example, modify eating habits based on the data obtained.
 For the whole family
 More members can be added to the mobile app so the whole family can use it. During weighing, the balance automatically recognizes the person standing on it and assigns the measured values in the app. You will get a comprehensive overview of the physical parameters and health of all family members. Data from the application can be shared with friends and thus motivate each other or send data to e.g. your doctor.

It comes with 2 attachments and a safety sensor to protect your eyes. It offers 5 intensity levels, 2 modes and has a lifetime of 300,000 pulses.
Long-lasting smooth skin
Do you want smooth skin? With the Concept IL3020 Perfect Skin IPL Depilator, you can achieve it in the comfort of your own home. The IL3020 uses Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) technology, which has been through more than 15 years of clinical research around the world. It enables the treatment in 2 modes and 5 levels depending on the skin tone. It is equipped with 2 interchangeable attachments, with which you can easily remove hair from the legs, hands and sensitive areas of the bikini, armpits and face (cheeks, upper lip, chin). The device is easy to use and its depilation is painless and long-lasting. The lifetime of the Depilator reaches 300,000 light pulses.
IPL technology
This scientifically proven technology provides fast and lasting results. During epilation, flashes of intense pulses reach the surface of the skin, where they act on the dark pigment of the hair. This effect effectively and painlessly damages the hair, even at the roots, and prevents it from regrowth. With regular and correct use, you will get smooth skin for up to several months.
Don't wait for summer
If you want to have beautiful and smooth skin in summer, start Depilation well in advance as the skin must not be exposed to sunlight for at least 4 weeks before and at least 2 weeks after using the IPL epilator. If you have applied self-tanning cream to your skin, wait until the tan has completely disappeared. The IPL Depilator can be used by both men and women over 18 years of age.
Who is the IPL epilator for?
Depilation with the IPL epilator is most effective for people with lighter skin and darker hair that contains a dark pigment. The lighter the hair and the darker the skin type, the less effective the IPL epilator is.

Proper use
The skin you intend to depilate must be clean, dry and shaved before using the IPL depilator. Choose the right light intensity level for your skin type or depending on the sensitivity of the area where the light will act. Press the epilator application area against your skin. After pressing the button, the device emits a light pulse. Avoid releasing more than one impulse on the same part of the skin in one treatment. You may feel a slight warmth or tingling sensation while epilating, but it should never be painful. If you feel pain, it is necessary to reduce the intensity of the radiation.
Eye protection
The IPL depilator has a built-in safety sensor that prevents you from sending an impulse when you point the epilator out into an open space. Thanks to this sensor, the device will only work properly when the application surface is in full contact with the skin.
PRECISION mode
It is suitable for removing hair from the most inaccessible and sensitive areas such as the face, armpits, bikini area, etc. The device emits single pulses when the pulse trigger button is pressed.
GLISS mode
This mode is suitable for removing hair from larger areas such as legs, arms, back, etc. Slowly move the device over the skin without lifting it. The epilator emits smooth flashes in a row for faster and smoother treatments.
When not to use the IPL depilator
The IPL depilator must not be used on tattooed body parts, areas with permanent makeup, freckles, birthmarks, or other dark marks. Cover these areas thoroughly before use. At the same time, IPL hair removal is not recommended for people with very sensitive skin, skin diseases, varicose veins and for pregnant and lactating women. If you are sick or simply unsure if IPL hair removal is right for you, consult your dermatologist or doctor.

 ZV2010 Perfect Air combines a humidifier and an aroma diffuser. It has a filter that catches bacteria in the water and helps create the perfect environment for healthy breathing at home. Modern design is highlighted with colorful backlight, which you can change as you like. 
 Healthy breathing 
 Do you often have allergies? One reason may be dry air in the apartment or office. Low humidity increases the risk of respiratory diseases, aggravates allergies, asthma and can affect general fatigue. ZV2010 is an ideal first aid because it increases the humidity in the room. Thanks to very quiet operation, you can place it in the bedroom or next to your child's cot.

An aroma that helps 
 The ZV2010 is equipped with a special aroma drawer, to which you can add a few drops of your favorite fragrance at any time without switching off the humidifier. In an instant you will create an atmosphere that evokes a pleasant feeling and relaxes the mind. The smell of eucalyptus e.g. relieves headaches, relaxes the airways and generally strengthens the immune system; the scent of lavender, mint and citronella repels flies and mosquitoes. 
 Ultrasounds 
 Ultrasonic humidifiers are among the most effective and are particularly suitable where you want to achieve a quick effect. Their main advantage is high efficiency and low energy consumption. ZV2010 lets in air up to 400 ml of water per hour, so it can be placed in larger spaces (up to 56 m2). 
 Simple operation 
 The humidifier is equipped with a readable digital display that ensures quick and easy operation. You can choose between hot or cold steam emissions and adjust the flow rate and humidity accordingly. It has a 4.5-liter large water tank, enough for 32 hours of operation. When the water tank is empty, the humidifier switches off automatically.

 Do you want to feel really safe at home? VR3000 is another friend to help you fight viruses and bacteria. Just add the appropriate disinfectant to the water tank and start the robot. Your floors will be perfectly clean and disinfected. 
 He's not afraid of anything 
 Nothing can stop him. Dusts but also wipes. It cleans any surface, except for carpets up to 1.5 cm high. It's so quiet it won't bother you. A large 600 ml tank is used for vacuuming. There is a turbo brush in the central body that will clean not only the hair, but also fine dust. Together with the side brushes, it perfectly sucks garbage from corners of the room. If you want to wipe the floor, replace the trash can with a 370ml water tank with a cleaning cloth. You can wash the cloth in the washing machine, and if you wear out the fabric or brushes, a free replacement box is included. 
 Gyroscopic navigation 
 Gyro navigation allows you to vacuum almost the entire floor area. Achieves up to 98% coverage of tiled floors. It provides excellent orientation in space, and thus reduces cleaning time. It also prevents you from working in the same place. Thanks to the application, you can control which places have been cleaned. 
 Control 
 The robot can be controlled using the We Back application, which is available in English and is free for iOS and Android. You can control it from anywhere and at any time, just select the appropriate program. You can also control the vacuum cleaner with Alexa or Google Home voice assistant. And if you're not a fan of the app or don't have a smartphone, you can control the robot with the LED display or remote control.

Efficient BLDC motor 
 The high suction power is mainly due to the BLDC brushless motor which has many advantages. The motor is quieter, more reliable, more energy efficient and more durable than ordinary motors. 
 Environmentally friendly 
 This elegant device can be classified as environmentally friendly. It recognizes when it's cleaned and automatically switches to standby before switching to the next job program. Thus, it saves the Li-Ion battery and extends its life. 
 5 cleaning modes 
 You can choose up to 5 cleaning modes or schedule a deferred cleaning. In TURBO mode, it will demonstrate its incredible cleaning power. AUTO SMART effectively cleans the entire space. Circuit mode provides cleaning along the wall and circular mode only where needed. There is also a quick 30 minute cleanup. 
 Smarter than it seems 
 Don't be afraid of the robot working near stairs or other obstacles. It can overcome obstacles up to 1.5 cm high, so you don't have to worry about thresholds between rooms. It is only 7.5 cm tall, so it can clean surfaces, e.g. under a cupboard or bed. It has anti-impact and anti-fall function. After detecting a low battery level, it automatically finds the charging station, where it waits for further cleaning.

With the CA3000 air purifier with humidifier, you can remove contaminants from the room that arise in households or in the environment. It has 8 air cleaning speeds and an efficiency of 488 m3 / h. It is quiet, easy to move and suitable for rooms up to 60 m2. Thanks to its modern design, it does not disturb the interior. Equipped with a timer that can be set for up to 12 hours and a practical child-proof lock. It will help relieve the symptoms of allergies, chronic and acute diseases of the respiratory tract, heart and blood vessels. It removes dust, various types of allergens, bacteria, viruses, odors, smog and other dangerous substances from the air. Give yourself and your family a better, healthier atmosphere.
7-stage filtration
Filtration is the most important cleaning process that determines air quality. The CA3000 is equipped with a 7-stage filter system to trap impurities and prevent them from spreading. It can remove up to 99.9% of air pollutants. Each individual filter layer captures certain types of pollutants, and by working together, you get perfectly clean air in your home. Thanks to advanced technology, the device monitors the current status of the filters and reminds you to replace them.
Air quality sensor
The air purifier is equipped with a pollution sensor that allows you to see in real time the dust (PM2.5) floating in the air in the room. Once started, it works in fully automatic mode so you don't have to worry about anything. It reads the current status independently and sets the optimal cleaning speed according to the recognized values. The exact value is shown on the easy-to-read LED display. You can visually check the air quality with a colored backlight that changes depending on the degree of pollution: Green = excellent air quality (up to 80 PM2.5) • Blue = light pollution (81 - 120 PM2.5) • Yellow = medium pollution (121 - 160 PM2.5) • red = heavily polluted (161 PM2.5 and more)
Humidifier
The CA3000 air purifier also has an air humidifier function. Your home gets rid of uncomfortable dry air, which increases the risk of respiratory illnesses, exacerbates allergies and asthma, and can contribute to overall fatigue. Simply fill the humidifier container with water, turn on the device to instantly increase the humidity in the room and maintain a healthier breathing environment. It reaches a maximum capacity of 86 ml / h. One filling is enough for 54 hours of humidification.
Concept home mobile application
You can control the air purifier from anywhere with the Concept Home mobile app, which is available free of charge for iOS and Android. Thanks to this, you can remotely switch the device on or off, adjust the cleaning speed, check the condition of the filters or, for example, the current air condition in the room. And if you're not a fan of the app, you can control it with the remote control or the buttons right on the display.
Quality sleep
Clean air also affects the quality of sleep, which is why the air purifier is equipped with a night mode. When it is dark, the CA3000 automatically switches to SMART mode (you can also set it manually using the SLEEP button). The air purifier then works quietly, only 30 dB, and the display with its colored background lighting goes out. So you can enjoy clean air while sleeping without any obstacles. In the morning you wake up refreshed and relaxed.
Filter properties
Dust filter - captures coarse air pollutants such as dust particles, hair, animal hair, pollen and other.
Catalytic filter - elliminates  ammonia, benzene and other dangerous substances that can be released from new furniture and carpets, for example.
Carbon filter - absorbs toxic, asphyxiating gases and vapors of various origins such as formaldehyde (released from new floors, furniture or building materials), benzene or cigarette smoke.
Antibacterial filter - eliminates bacteria and prevents mold from forming.
HEPA filter 13 - captures particles from 0.1 micrometers with an efficiency of 99.9% (dust, pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, allergens, mold spores, etc.).
UV lamp and ionizer
Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and absorbs odors. The ionizer uses an electrical discharge to increase the amount of negatively charged ions in the air (known as air vitamins) that improve overall air quality. Their quantity has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, concentration, efficiency and the fight against headaches. At the same time, the ionizer absorbs positively charged dust particles, viruses, bacteria and removes cigarette smoke. Both functions can be carried out independently of one another.
Do you really want to feel safe at home? CA3000 is another part of a range of helpers that help keep the home cleaner and healthier. Thanks to an efficient filter system, up to 99.9% of bacteria, viruses and allergens are removed from the air.
What is PM2.5?
These are particles in the air with a maximum diameter of 2.5 microns. To illustrate, these are particles that are on average up to 28 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair and 36 times smaller than a grain of sand. Inhaling them can have adverse effects on human health.

With the CA3000 air purifier with humidifier, you can remove contaminants from the room that arise in households or in the environment. It has 8 air cleaning speeds and an efficiency of 488 m3 / h. It is quiet, easy to move and suitable for rooms up to 60 m2. Thanks to its modern design, it does not disturb the interior. Equipped with a timer that can be set for up to 12 hours and a practical child-proof lock. It will help relieve the symptoms of allergies, chronic and acute diseases of the respiratory tract, heart and blood vessels. It removes dust, various types of allergens, bacteria, viruses, odors, smog and other dangerous substances from the air. Give yourself and your family a better, healthier atmosphere.
7-stage filtration
Filtration is the most important cleaning process that determines air quality. The CA3000 is equipped with a 7-stage filter system to trap impurities and prevent them from spreading. It can remove up to 99.9% of air pollutants. Each individual filter layer captures certain types of pollutants, and by working together, you get perfectly clean air in your home. Thanks to advanced technology, the device monitors the current status of the filters and reminds you to replace them.
Air quality sensor
The air purifier is equipped with a pollution sensor that allows you to see in real time the dust (PM2.5) floating in the air in the room. Once started, it works in fully automatic mode so you don't have to worry about anything. It reads the current status independently and sets the optimal cleaning speed according to the recognized values. The exact value is shown on the easy-to-read LED display. You can visually check the air quality with a colored backlight that changes depending on the degree of pollution: Green = excellent air quality (up to 80 PM2.5) • Blue = light pollution (81 - 120 PM2.5) • Yellow = medium pollution (121 - 160 PM2.5) • red = heavily polluted (161 PM2.5 and more)
Humidifier
The CA3000 air purifier also has an air humidifier function. Your home gets rid of uncomfortable dry air, which increases the risk of respiratory illnesses, exacerbates allergies and asthma, and can contribute to overall fatigue. Simply fill the humidifier container with water, turn on the device to instantly increase the humidity in the room and maintain a healthier breathing environment. It reaches a maximum capacity of 86 ml / h. One filling is enough for 54 hours of humidification.
Concept home mobile application
You can control the air purifier from anywhere with the Concept Home mobile app, which is available free of charge for iOS and Android. Thanks to this, you can remotely switch the device on or off, adjust the cleaning speed, check the condition of the filters or, for example, the current air condition in the room. And if you're not a fan of the app, you can control it with the remote control or the buttons right on the display.
Quality sleep
Clean air also affects the quality of sleep, which is why the air purifier is equipped with a night mode. When it is dark, the CA3000 automatically switches to SMART mode (you can also set it manually using the SLEEP button). The air purifier then works quietly, only 30 dB, and the display with its colored background lighting goes out. So you can enjoy clean air while sleeping without any obstacles. In the morning you wake up refreshed and relaxed.
Filter properties
Dust filter - captures coarse air pollutants such as dust particles, hair, animal hair, pollen and other.
Catalytic filter - elliminates  ammonia, benzene and other dangerous substances that can be released from new furniture and carpets, for example.
Carbon filter - absorbs toxic, asphyxiating gases and vapors of various origins such as formaldehyde (released from new floors, furniture or building materials), benzene or cigarette smoke.
Antibacterial filter - eliminates bacteria and prevents mold from forming.
HEPA filter 13 - captures particles from 0.1 micrometers with an efficiency of 99.9% (dust, pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, allergens, mold spores, etc.).
UV lamp and ionizer
Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and absorbs odors. The ionizer uses an electrical discharge to increase the amount of negatively charged ions in the air (known as air vitamins) that improve overall air quality. Their quantity has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, concentration, efficiency and the fight against headaches. At the same time, the ionizer absorbs positively charged dust particles, viruses, bacteria and removes cigarette smoke. Both functions can be carried out independently of one another.
Do you really want to feel safe at home? CA3000 is another part of a range of helpers that help keep the home cleaner and healthier. Thanks to an efficient filter system, up to 99.9% of bacteria, viruses and allergens are removed from the air.
What is PM2.5?
These are particles in the air with a maximum diameter of 2.5 microns. To illustrate, these are particles that are on average up to 28 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair and 36 times smaller than a grain of sand. Inhaling them can have adverse effects on human health.

With the CA3000 air purifier with humidifier, you can remove contaminants from the room that arise in households or in the environment. It has 8 air cleaning speeds and an efficiency of 488 m3 / h. It is quiet, easy to move and suitable for rooms up to 60 m2. Thanks to its modern design, it does not disturb the interior. Equipped with a timer that can be set for up to 12 hours and a practical child-proof lock. It will help relieve the symptoms of allergies, chronic and acute diseases of the respiratory tract, heart and blood vessels. It removes dust, various types of allergens, bacteria, viruses, odors, smog and other dangerous substances from the air. Give yourself and your family a better, healthier atmosphere.
7-stage filtration
Filtration is the most important cleaning process that determines air quality. The CA3000 is equipped with a 7-stage filter system to trap impurities and prevent them from spreading. It can remove up to 99.9% of air pollutants. Each individual filter layer captures certain types of pollutants, and by working together, you get perfectly clean air in your home. Thanks to advanced technology, the device monitors the current status of the filters and reminds you to replace them.
Air quality sensor
The air purifier is equipped with a pollution sensor that allows you to see in real time the dust (PM2.5) floating in the air in the room. Once started, it works in fully automatic mode so you don't have to worry about anything. It reads the current status independently and sets the optimal cleaning speed according to the recognized values. The exact value is shown on the easy-to-read LED display. You can visually check the air quality with a colored backlight that changes depending on the degree of pollution: Green = excellent air quality (up to 80 PM2.5) • Blue = light pollution (81 - 120 PM2.5) • Yellow = medium pollution (121 - 160 PM2.5) • red = heavily polluted (161 PM2.5 and more)
Humidifier
The CA3000 air purifier also has an air humidifier function. Your home gets rid of uncomfortable dry air, which increases the risk of respiratory illnesses, exacerbates allergies and asthma, and can contribute to overall fatigue. Simply fill the humidifier container with water, turn on the device to instantly increase the humidity in the room and maintain a healthier breathing environment. It reaches a maximum capacity of 86 ml / h. One filling is enough for 54 hours of humidification.
Concept home mobile application
You can control the air purifier from anywhere with the Concept Home mobile app, which is available free of charge for iOS and Android. Thanks to this, you can remotely switch the device on or off, adjust the cleaning speed, check the condition of the filters or, for example, the current air condition in the room. And if you're not a fan of the app, you can control it with the remote control or the buttons right on the display.
Quality sleep
Clean air also affects the quality of sleep, which is why the air purifier is equipped with a night mode. When it is dark, the CA3000 automatically switches to SMART mode (you can also set it manually using the SLEEP button). The air purifier then works quietly, only 30 dB, and the display with its colored background lighting goes out. So you can enjoy clean air while sleeping without any obstacles. In the morning you wake up refreshed and relaxed.
Filter properties
Dust filter - captures coarse air pollutants such as dust particles, hair, animal hair, pollen and other.
Catalytic filter - elliminates  ammonia, benzene and other dangerous substances that can be released from new furniture and carpets, for example.
Carbon filter - absorbs toxic, asphyxiating gases and vapors of various origins such as formaldehyde (released from new floors, furniture or building materials), benzene or cigarette smoke.
Antibacterial filter - eliminates bacteria and prevents mold from forming.
HEPA filter 13 - captures particles from 0.1 micrometers with an efficiency of 99.9% (dust, pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, allergens, mold spores, etc.).
UV lamp and ionizer
Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and absorbs odors. The ionizer uses an electrical discharge to increase the amount of negatively charged ions in the air (known as air vitamins) that improve overall air quality. Their quantity has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, concentration, efficiency and the fight against headaches. At the same time, the ionizer absorbs positively charged dust particles, viruses, bacteria and removes cigarette smoke. Both functions can be carried out independently of one another.
Do you really want to feel safe at home? CA3000 is another part of a range of helpers that help keep the home cleaner and healthier. Thanks to an efficient filter system, up to 99.9% of bacteria, viruses and allergens are removed from the air.
What is PM2.5?
These are particles in the air with a maximum diameter of 2.5 microns. To illustrate, these are particles that are on average up to 28 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair and 36 times smaller than a grain of sand. Inhaling them can have adverse effects on human health.

It comes with 2 attachments and a safety sensor to protect your eyes. It offers 5 intensity levels, 2 modes and has a lifetime of 300,000 pulses.
Long-lasting smooth skin
Do you want smooth skin? With the Concept IL3020 Perfect Skin IPL Depilator, you can achieve it in the comfort of your own home. The IL3020 uses Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) technology, which has been through more than 15 years of clinical research around the world. It enables the treatment in 2 modes and 5 levels depending on the skin tone. It is equipped with 2 interchangeable attachments, with which you can easily remove hair from the legs, hands and sensitive areas of the bikini, armpits and face (cheeks, upper lip, chin). The device is easy to use and its depilation is painless and long-lasting. The lifetime of the Depilator reaches 300,000 light pulses.
IPL technology
This scientifically proven technology provides fast and lasting results. During epilation, flashes of intense pulses reach the surface of the skin, where they act on the dark pigment of the hair. This effect effectively and painlessly damages the hair, even at the roots, and prevents it from regrowth. With regular and correct use, you will get smooth skin for up to several months.
Don't wait for summer
If you want to have beautiful and smooth skin in summer, start Depilation well in advance as the skin must not be exposed to sunlight for at least 4 weeks before and at least 2 weeks after using the IPL epilator. If you have applied self-tanning cream to your skin, wait until the tan has completely disappeared. The IPL Depilator can be used by both men and women over 18 years of age.
Who is the IPL epilator for?
Depilation with the IPL epilator is most effective for people with lighter skin and darker hair that contains a dark pigment. The lighter the hair and the darker the skin type, the less effective the IPL epilator is.

Proper use
The skin you intend to depilate must be clean, dry and shaved before using the IPL depilator. Choose the right light intensity level for your skin type or depending on the sensitivity of the area where the light will act. Press the epilator application area against your skin. After pressing the button, the device emits a light pulse. Avoid releasing more than one impulse on the same part of the skin in one treatment. You may feel a slight warmth or tingling sensation while epilating, but it should never be painful. If you feel pain, it is necessary to reduce the intensity of the radiation.
Eye protection
The IPL depilator has a built-in safety sensor that prevents you from sending an impulse when you point the epilator out into an open space. Thanks to this sensor, the device will only work properly when the application surface is in full contact with the skin.
PRECISION mode
It is suitable for removing hair from the most inaccessible and sensitive areas such as the face, armpits, bikini area, etc. The device emits single pulses when the pulse trigger button is pressed.
GLISS mode
This mode is suitable for removing hair from larger areas such as legs, arms, back, etc. Slowly move the device over the skin without lifting it. The epilator emits smooth flashes in a row for faster and smoother treatments.
When not to use the IPL depilator
The IPL depilator must not be used on tattooed body parts, areas with permanent makeup, freckles, birthmarks, or other dark marks. Cover these areas thoroughly before use. At the same time, IPL hair removal is not recommended for people with very sensitive skin, skin diseases, varicose veins and for pregnant and lactating women. If you are sick or simply unsure if IPL hair removal is right for you, consult your dermatologist or doctor.

Long-lasting smooth skin
Do you want smooth skin? With the Concept IL3020 Perfect Skin IPL Depilator, you can achieve it in the comfort of your own home. The IL3020 uses Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) technology, which has been through more than 15 years of clinical research around the world. It enables the treatment in 2 modes and 5 levels depending on the skin tone. It is equipped with 2 interchangeable attachments, with which you can easily remove hair from the legs, hands and sensitive areas of the bikini, armpits and face (cheeks, upper lip, chin). The device is easy to use and its depilation is painless and long-lasting. The lifetime of the Depilator reaches 300,000 light pulses.
IPL technology
This scientifically proven technology provides fast and lasting results. During epilation, flashes of intense pulses reach the surface of the skin, where they act on the dark pigment of the hair. This effect effectively and painlessly damages the hair, even at the roots, and prevents it from regrowth. With regular and correct use, you will get smooth skin for up to several months.
Don't wait for summer
If you want to have beautiful and smooth skin in summer, start Depilation well in advance as the skin must not be exposed to sunlight for at least 4 weeks before and at least 2 weeks after using the IPL epilator. If you have applied self-tanning cream to your skin, wait until the tan has completely disappeared. The IPL Depilator can be used by both men and women over 18 years of age.
Who is the IPL epilator for?
Depilation with the IPL epilator is most effective for people with lighter skin and darker hair that contains a dark pigment. The lighter the hair and the darker the skin type, the less effective the IPL epilator is.

Proper use
The skin you intend to depilate must be clean, dry and shaved before using the IPL depilator. Choose the right light intensity level for your skin type or depending on the sensitivity of the area where the light will act. Press the epilator application area against your skin. After pressing the button, the device emits a light pulse. Avoid releasing more than one impulse on the same part of the skin in one treatment. You may feel a slight warmth or tingling sensation while epilating, but it should never be painful. If you feel pain, it is necessary to reduce the intensity of the radiation.

 Healthy breathing 
 Do you often have allergies? One reason may be dry air in the apartment or office. Low humidity increases the risk of respiratory diseases, aggravates allergies, asthma and can affect general fatigue. ZV2010 is an ideal first aid because it increases the humidity in the room.

 Ionization 
 Our dehumidifier is two devices. It can dry and clean the air in one step, because it represents both a purifier and a dryer. Ionization is another very important function of the purifier. The air is ionized by means of an electric discharge, increases the amount of ions in the air that help to clean them. Their number has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, better concentration, increased efficiency, and especially helps fight headaches. 
 Moisture indicator 
 The indicator shows orange, green or red. The color changes depending on the humidity change in the room. When the humidity drops below 50%, the light turns orange. The green color will glow when the humidity is about 50-70%. The last red color indicates humidity exceeding 70%.

 Excessive humidity in our homes causes not only material damage, but can also threaten our health. High humidity is an ideal environment for mold growth that can cause health complications such as sinusitis, bronchitis or other respiratory diseases. If there is mold in your apartment or basement, there is likely to be high humidity. At values ​​above 50%, the dehumidifier is the perfect helper that protects not only your health, but also your property. 
 Drying modes 
 The OV2000 dehumidifier is suitable for rooms up to 120 m2. You can choose one of four drying modes. Silent mode is ideal if you are going to sleep in the room, you can set the humidity in this case from 35 to 80% in five steps. The so-called ""dry"" mode will be used especially when drying clothes, drying cabinets or small areas where the air flows to the maximum. You can also choose either continuous or automatic mode. In automatic mode, the humidity is set to 55%. 
 Large volume 
 In one day it can condense up to 20 liters of water. In this way, you can use it not only at home, but also in indoor pools or conservatories. After filling a large - 5, 5 l container, the device will turn off automatically. You do not have to drain water from the device, just connect the hose. Wheels allow easy operation, thanks to which the device can easily be moved from room to room.

Clean Air 
 The ""AIR CLEAN"" button is used to start the air cleaning mode. The fan is turning and the compressor is not working. The OV2000 dehumidifier also has an outlet for the dried air. You simply set the flap and the air is evenly distributed throughout the room. 
 Ionization 
 Our dehumidifier is two devices. It can dry and clean the air in one step, because it represents both a purifier and a dryer. Ionization is another very important function of the purifier. The air is ionized by means of an electric discharge, increases the amount of ions in the air that help to clean them. Their number has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, better concentration, increased efficiency, and especially helps fight headaches. 
 Moisture indicator 
 The indicator shows orange, green or red. The color changes depending on the humidity change in the room. When the humidity drops below 50%, the light turns orange. The green color will glow when the humidity is about 50-70%. The last red color indicates humidity exceeding 70%.

 Excessive humidity in our homes causes not only material damage, but can also threaten our health. High humidity is an ideal environment for mold growth that can cause health complications such as sinusitis, bronchitis or other respiratory diseases. If there is mold in your apartment or basement, there is likely to be high humidity. At values ​​above 50%, the dehumidifier is the perfect helper that protects not only your health, but also your property. 
 Drying modes 
 The OV2000 dehumidifier is suitable for rooms up to 120 m2. You can choose one of four drying modes. Silent mode is ideal if you are going to sleep in the room, you can set the humidity in this case from 35 to 80% in five steps. The so-called ""dry"" mode will be used especially when drying clothes, drying cabinets or small areas where the air flows to the maximum. You can also choose either continuous or automatic mode. In automatic mode, the humidity is set to 55%. 
 Large volume

 The ""AIR CLEAN"" button is used to start the air cleaning mode. The fan is turning and the compressor is not working. The OV2000 dehumidifier also has an outlet for the dried air. You simply set the flap and the air is evenly distributed throughout the room. 
 Ionization 
 Our dehumidifier is two devices. It can dry and clean the air in one step, because it represents both a purifier and a dryer. Ionization is another very important function of the purifier. The air is ionized by means of an electric discharge, increases the amount of ions in the air that help to clean them. Their number has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, better concentration, increased efficiency, and especially helps fight headaches. 
 Moisture indicator 
 The indicator shows orange, green or red. The color changes depending on the humidity change in the room. When the humidity drops below 50%, the light turns orange. The green color will glow when the humidity is about 50-70%. The last red color indicates humidity exceeding 70%.

 Excessive humidity in our homes causes not only material damage, but can also threaten our health. High humidity is an ideal environment for mold growth that can cause health complications such as sinusitis, bronchitis or other respiratory diseases. If there is mold in your apartment or basement, there is likely to be high humidity. At values ​​above 50%, the dehumidifier is the perfect helper that protects not only your health, but also your property. 
 Drying modes 
 The OV2000 dehumidifier is suitable for rooms up to 120 m2. You can choose one of four drying modes. Silent mode is ideal if you are going to sleep in the room, you can set the humidity in this case from 35 to 80% in five steps. The so-called ""dry"" mode will be used especially when drying clothes, drying cabinets or small areas where the air flows to the maximum. You can also choose either continuous or automatic mode. In automatic mode, the humidity is set to 55%. 
 Large volume 
 In one day it can condense up to 20 liters of water. In this way, you can use it not only at home, but also in indoor pools or conservatories. After filling a large - 5, 5 l container, the device will turn off automatically. You do not have to drain water from the device, just connect the hose. Wheels allow easy operation, thanks to which the device can easily be moved from room to room.

Clean Air 
 The ""AIR CLEAN"" button is used to start the air cleaning mode. The fan is turning and the compressor is not working. The OV2000 dehumidifier also has an outlet for the dried air. You simply set the flap and the air is evenly distributed throughout the room. 
 Ionization 
 Our dehumidifier is two devices. It can dry and clean the air in one step, because it represents both a purifier and a dryer. Ionization is another very important function of the purifier. The air is ionized by means of an electric discharge, increases the amount of ions in the air that help to clean them. Their number has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, better concentration, increased efficiency, and especially helps fight headaches. 
 Moisture indicator 
 The indicator shows orange, green or red. The color changes depending on the humidity change in the room. When the humidity drops below 50%, the light turns orange. The green color will glow when the humidity is about 50-70%. The last red color indicates humidity exceeding 70%.

 Do you want to feel really safe at home? VR3000 is another friend to help you fight viruses and bacteria. Just add the appropriate disinfectant to the water tank and start the robot. Your floors will be perfectly clean and disinfected. 
 He's not afraid of anything 
 Nothing can stop him. Dusts but also wipes. It cleans any surface, except for carpets up to 1.5 cm high. It's so quiet it won't bother you. A large 600 ml tank is used for vacuuming. There is a turbo brush in the central body that will clean not only the hair, but also fine dust. Together with the side brushes, it perfectly sucks garbage from corners of the room. If you want to wipe the floor, replace the trash can with a 370ml water tank with a cleaning cloth. You can wash the cloth in the washing machine, and if you wear out the fabric or brushes, a free replacement box is included. 
 Gyroscopic navigation 
 Gyro navigation allows you to vacuum almost the entire floor area. Achieves up to 98% coverage of tiled floors. It provides excellent orientation in space, and thus reduces cleaning time. It also prevents you from working in the same place. Thanks to the application, you can control which places have been cleaned. 
 Control 
 The robot can be controlled using the We Back application, which is available in English and is free for iOS and Android. You can control it from anywhere and at any time, just select the appropriate program. You can also control the vacuum cleaner with Alexa or Google Home voice assistant. And if you're not a fan of the app or don't have a smartphone, you can control the robot with the LED display or remote control.

Efficient BLDC motor 
 The high suction power is mainly due to the BLDC brushless motor which has many advantages. The motor is quieter, more reliable, more energy efficient and more durable than ordinary motors. 
 Environmentally friendly 
 This elegant device can be classified as environmentally friendly. It recognizes when it's cleaned and automatically switches to standby before switching to the next job program. Thus, it saves the Li-Ion battery and extends its life. 
 5 cleaning modes 
 You can choose up to 5 cleaning modes or schedule a deferred cleaning. In TURBO mode, it will demonstrate its incredible cleaning power. AUTO SMART effectively cleans the entire space. Circuit mode provides cleaning along the wall and circular mode only where needed. There is also a quick 30 minute cleanup. 
 Smarter than it seems 
 Don't be afraid of the robot working near stairs or other obstacles. It can overcome obstacles up to 1.5 cm high, so you don't have to worry about thresholds between rooms. It is only 7.5 cm tall, so it can clean surfaces, e.g. under a cupboard or bed. It has anti-impact and anti-fall function. After detecting a low battery level, it automatically finds the charging station, where it waits for further cleaning.

With the CA3000 air purifier with humidifier, you can remove contaminants from the room that arise in households or in the environment. It has 8 air cleaning speeds and an efficiency of 488 m3 / h. It is quiet, easy to move and suitable for rooms up to 60 m2. Thanks to its modern design, it does not disturb the interior. Equipped with a timer that can be set for up to 12 hours and a practical child-proof lock. It will help relieve the symptoms of allergies, chronic and acute diseases of the respiratory tract, heart and blood vessels. It removes dust, various types of allergens, bacteria, viruses, odors, smog and other dangerous substances from the air. Give yourself and your family a better, healthier atmosphere.
7-stage filtration
Filtration is the most important cleaning process that determines air quality. The CA3000 is equipped with a 7-stage filter system to trap impurities and prevent them from spreading. It can remove up to 99.9% of air pollutants. Each individual filter layer captures certain types of pollutants, and by working together, you get perfectly clean air in your home. Thanks to advanced technology, the device monitors the current status of the filters and reminds you to replace them.
Air quality sensor
The air purifier is equipped with a pollution sensor that allows you to see in real time the dust (PM2.5) floating in the air in the room. Once started, it works in fully automatic mode so you don't have to worry about anything. It reads the current status independently and sets the optimal cleaning speed according to the recognized values. The exact value is shown on the easy-to-read LED display. You can visually check the air quality with a colored backlight that changes depending on the degree of pollution: Green = excellent air quality (up to 80 PM2.5) • Blue = light pollution (81 - 120 PM2.5) • Yellow = medium pollution (121 - 160 PM2.5) • red = heavily polluted (161 PM2.5 and more)
Humidifier
The CA3000 air purifier also has an air humidifier function. Your home gets rid of uncomfortable dry air, which increases the risk of respiratory illnesses, exacerbates allergies and asthma, and can contribute to overall fatigue. Simply fill the humidifier container with water, turn on the device to instantly increase the humidity in the room and maintain a healthier breathing environment. It reaches a maximum capacity of 86 ml / h. One filling is enough for 54 hours of humidification.
Concept home mobile application
You can control the air purifier from anywhere with the Concept Home mobile app, which is available free of charge for iOS and Android. Thanks to this, you can remotely switch the device on or off, adjust the cleaning speed, check the condition of the filters or, for example, the current air condition in the room. And if you're not a fan of the app, you can control it with the remote control or the buttons right on the display.
Quality sleep
Clean air also affects the quality of sleep, which is why the air purifier is equipped with a night mode. When it is dark, the CA3000 automatically switches to SMART mode (you can also set it manually using the SLEEP button). The air purifier then works quietly, only 30 dB, and the display with its colored background lighting goes out. So you can enjoy clean air while sleeping without any obstacles. In the morning you wake up refreshed and relaxed.
Filter properties
Dust filter - captures coarse air pollutants such as dust particles, hair, animal hair, pollen and other.
Catalytic filter - elliminates  ammonia, benzene and other dangerous substances that can be released from new furniture and carpets, for example.
Carbon filter - absorbs toxic, asphyxiating gases and vapors of various origins such as formaldehyde (released from new floors, furniture or building materials), benzene or cigarette smoke.
Antibacterial filter - eliminates bacteria and prevents mold from forming.
HEPA filter 13 - captures particles from 0.1 micrometers with an efficiency of 99.9% (dust, pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, allergens, mold spores, etc.).
UV lamp and ionizer
Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and absorbs odors. The ionizer uses an electrical discharge to increase the amount of negatively charged ions in the air (known as air vitamins) that improve overall air quality. Their quantity has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, concentration, efficiency and the fight against headaches. At the same time, the ionizer absorbs positively charged dust particles, viruses, bacteria and removes cigarette smoke. Both functions can be carried out independently of one another.
Do you really want to feel safe at home? CA3000 is another part of a range of helpers that help keep the home cleaner and healthier. Thanks to an efficient filter system, up to 99.9% of bacteria, viruses and allergens are removed from the air.
What is PM2.5?
These are particles in the air with a maximum diameter of 2.5 microns. To illustrate, these are particles that are on average up to 28 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair and 36 times smaller than a grain of sand. Inhaling them can have adverse effects on human health.

It can measure 13 body parameters using bioelectric impedance. With the Feelfit app you will have all your data under control.
 Health under control
 Thanks to the intelligent Concept VO4010 Perfect Health scale, you will have your health under control. In addition to body weight, it can analyze 12 parameters, incl. adipose tissue, muscle mass, or metabolic age.
 Full body analysis
 The VO4010 diagnostic scale can measure 12 body parameters: body weight, BMI, adipose tissue, lean mass, subcutaneous fat, body water, skeletal mass, muscle mass, bone mass, protein, BMR, metabolic age. Thanks to this scale, you will get a detailed overview of your current physical condition.

Feelfit mobile application
 In order to be able to fully use all functions of the scale, it is necessary to download the Feelfit application for a mobile phone or tablet, which is available in Polish and free of charge from Google Play (Android) or the App Store (iOS). During weighing, the current weight value is displayed on the scale's LED display. The rest of the data is automatically sent via Bluetooth to the mobile application, which processes, evaluates and saves it. Thanks to history, you can monitor your progress, evaluate the effectiveness of exercise, set new goals and, for example, modify eating habits based on the data obtained.
 For the whole family
 More members can be added to the mobile app so the whole family can use it. During weighing, the balance automatically recognizes the person standing on it and assigns the measured values in the app. You will get a comprehensive overview of the physical parameters and health of all family members. Data from the application can be shared with friends and thus motivate each other or send data to e.g. your doctor.

 Thanks to the intelligent Concept VO4010 Perfect Health scale, you will have your health under control. In addition to body weight, it can analyze 12 parameters, incl. adipose tissue, muscle mass, or metabolic age.
 Full body analysis
 The VO4010 diagnostic scale can measure 12 body parameters: body weight, BMI, adipose tissue, lean mass, subcutaneous fat, body water, skeletal mass, muscle mass, bone mass, protein, BMR, metabolic age. Thanks to this scale, you will get a detailed overview of your current physical condition.

Feelfit mobile application
 In order to be able to fully use all functions of the scale, it is necessary to download the Feelfit application for a mobile phone or tablet, which is available in Polish and free of charge from Google Play (Android) or the App Store (iOS). During weighing, the current weight value is displayed on the scale's LED display. The rest of the data is automatically sent via Bluetooth to the mobile application, which processes, evaluates and saves it. Thanks to history, you can monitor your progress, evaluate the effectiveness of exercise, set new goals and, for example, modify eating habits based on the data obtained.
 For the whole family
 More members can be added to the mobile app so the whole family can use it. During weighing, the balance automatically recognizes the person standing on it and assigns the measured values in the app. You will get a comprehensive overview of the physical parameters and health of all family members. Data from the application can be shared with friends and thus motivate each other or send data to e.g. your doctor.

 Economical LED lighting
 The cooker hood is equipped with an LED diode at the bottom and perfectly illuminates the hob during use. LED lighting is very cheap and has a long life.

Effective recirculation
 If you cannot get steam from the stove, use the recirculation function. In this case, it is necessary to add a carbon filter (not included) behind the grease filter, which absorbs odors. The air is cleaned and back into the room. The charcoal filter should be replaced regularly depending on how often the hood is used.
 Easy to clean grease filter
 The grease filter requires regular maintenance to provide you with good service. Remove the filter from the hood, put it in the dishwasher and run a lower temperature program (do not use aggressive cleaning agents). If you do not have a dishwasher, soak the filter in warm water and then clean it with a brush.

 If you cannot get steam from the stove, use the recirculation function. In this case, it is necessary to add a carbon filter (not included) behind the grease filter, which absorbs odors. The air is cleaned and back into the room. The charcoal filter should be replaced regularly depending on how often the hood is used.
 Easy to clean grease filter
 The grease filter requires regular maintenance to provide you with good service. Remove the filter from the hood, put it in the dishwasher and run a lower temperature program (do not use aggressive cleaning agents). If you do not have a dishwasher, soak the filter in warm water and then clean it with a brush.

It can measure 13 body parameters using bioelectric impedance. With the Feelfit app you will have all your data under control.
 Health under control
 Thanks to the intelligent personal scale Concept VO4001 Perfect Health you will have your health under control. In addition to body weight, it can analyze another 12 parameters, including adipose tissue, muscle mass, or metabolic age. .
 Full body analysis
 The VO4001 Personal Diagnostic Scale can measure 13 body parameters: body weight, BMI, body fat, lean mass, subcutaneous fat, body water, skeletal mass, muscle mass, bone mass, protein, BMR, metabolic age. Thanks to this scale, you will get a detailed overview of your current physical condition.
 Feelfit mobile application
 To be able to take full advantage of all the functions of the scale, you need to download the Feelfit app for your mobile phone or tablet, which is available in the Czech language and available for free on Google Play (Android) or the App Store (iOS).
 During weighing, the current weight value is displayed on the scale's LED display. The remaining data is automatically sent via Bluetooth to the mobile application, which processes, evaluates and saves it.
 Thanks to history, you can monitor your progress, evaluate the effectiveness of exercise, set new goals and, for example, modify eating habits based on the data obtained.

For the whole family
 More members can be added to the mobile app so the whole family can use it. During weighing, the balance automatically recognizes the person standing on it and assigns the measured values in the app. You will get a comprehensive overview of the physical parameters and health of all family members. Data from the application can be shared with friends and thus motivate each other or send data to e.g. your doctor.
 With maximum accuracy
 The values obtained are measured on the basis of the bioelectrical impedance (BIA). During weighing, built-in sensors send a weak electrical signal to the body which measures the body's electrical resistance, then calculates the fat and other components. In the blink of an eye you will receive detailed and accurate data about your body parameters.
 Modern design
 The minimalist design of the white glass plate and the low profile add elegance to the weight of the VO4001. Thanks to this design, it does not disturb the interior and fits perfectly into any apartment.

 Healthy breathing 
 Do you often have allergies? One reason may be dry air in the apartment or office. Low humidity increases the risk of respiratory diseases, aggravates allergies, asthma and can affect general fatigue. ZV2010 is an ideal first aid because it increases the humidity in the room. Thanks to very quiet operation, you can place it in the bedroom or next to your child's cot.

An aroma that helps 
 The ZV2010 is equipped with a special aroma drawer, to which you can add a few drops of your favorite fragrance at any time without switching off the humidifier. In an instant you will create an atmosphere that evokes a pleasant feeling and relaxes the mind. The smell of eucalyptus e.g. relieves headaches, relaxes the airways and generally strengthens the immune system; the scent of lavender, mint and citronella repels flies and mosquitoes. 
 Ultrasounds 
 Ultrasonic humidifiers are among the most effective and are particularly suitable where you want to achieve a quick effect. Their main advantage is high efficiency and low energy consumption. ZV2010 lets in air up to 400 ml of water per hour, so it can be placed in larger spaces (up to 56 m2).

With the CA3000 air purifier with humidifier, you can remove contaminants from the room that arise in households or in the environment. It has 8 air cleaning speeds and an efficiency of 488 m3 / h. It is quiet, easy to move and suitable for rooms up to 60 m2. Thanks to its modern design, it does not disturb the interior. Equipped with a timer that can be set for up to 12 hours and a practical child-proof lock. It will help relieve the symptoms of allergies, chronic and acute diseases of the respiratory tract, heart and blood vessels. It removes dust, various types of allergens, bacteria, viruses, odors, smog and other dangerous substances from the air. Give yourself and your family a better, healthier atmosphere.
7-stage filtration
Filtration is the most important cleaning process that determines air quality. The CA3000 is equipped with a 7-stage filter system to trap impurities and prevent them from spreading. It can remove up to 99.9% of air pollutants. Each individual filter layer captures certain types of pollutants, and by working together, you get perfectly clean air in your home. Thanks to advanced technology, the device monitors the current status of the filters and reminds you to replace them.
Air quality sensor
The air purifier is equipped with a pollution sensor that allows you to see in real time the dust (PM2.5) floating in the air in the room. Once started, it works in fully automatic mode so you don't have to worry about anything. It reads the current status independently and sets the optimal cleaning speed according to the recognized values. The exact value is shown on the easy-to-read LED display. You can visually check the air quality with a colored backlight that changes depending on the degree of pollution: Green = excellent air quality (up to 80 PM2.5) • Blue = light pollution (81 - 120 PM2.5) • Yellow = medium pollution (121 - 160 PM2.5) • red = heavily polluted (161 PM2.5 and more)
Humidifier
The CA3000 air purifier also has an air humidifier function. Your home gets rid of uncomfortable dry air, which increases the risk of respiratory illnesses, exacerbates allergies and asthma, and can contribute to overall fatigue. Simply fill the humidifier container with water, turn on the device to instantly increase the humidity in the room and maintain a healthier breathing environment. It reaches a maximum capacity of 86 ml / h. One filling is enough for 54 hours of humidification.
Concept home mobile application
You can control the air purifier from anywhere with the Concept Home mobile app, which is available free of charge for iOS and Android. Thanks to this, you can remotely switch the device on or off, adjust the cleaning speed, check the condition of the filters or, for example, the current air condition in the room. And if you're not a fan of the app, you can control it with the remote control or the buttons right on the display.
Quality sleep
Clean air also affects the quality of sleep, which is why the air purifier is equipped with a night mode. When it is dark, the CA3000 automatically switches to SMART mode (you can also set it manually using the SLEEP button). The air purifier then works quietly, only 30 dB, and the display with its colored background lighting goes out. So you can enjoy clean air while sleeping without any obstacles. In the morning you wake up refreshed and relaxed.
Filter properties
Dust filter - captures coarse air pollutants such as dust particles, hair, animal hair, pollen and other.
Catalytic filter - elliminates  ammonia, benzene and other dangerous substances that can be released from new furniture and carpets, for example.
Carbon filter - absorbs toxic, asphyxiating gases and vapors of various origins such as formaldehyde (released from new floors, furniture or building materials), benzene or cigarette smoke.
Antibacterial filter - eliminates bacteria and prevents mold from forming.
HEPA filter 13 - captures particles from 0.1 micrometers with an efficiency of 99.9% (dust, pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, allergens, mold spores, etc.).
UV lamp and ionizer
Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and absorbs odors. The ionizer uses an electrical discharge to increase the amount of negatively charged ions in the air (known as air vitamins) that improve overall air quality. Their quantity has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, concentration, efficiency and the fight against headaches. At the same time, the ionizer absorbs positively charged dust particles, viruses, bacteria and removes cigarette smoke. Both functions can be carried out independently of one another.
Do you really want to feel safe at home? CA3000 is another part of a range of helpers that help keep the home cleaner and healthier. Thanks to an efficient filter system, up to 99.9% of bacteria, viruses and allergens are removed from the air.
What is PM2.5?
These are particles in the air with a maximum diameter of 2.5 microns. To illustrate, these are particles that are on average up to 28 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair and 36 times smaller than a grain of sand. Inhaling them can have adverse effects on human health.

Multifunctional device for cavitation peeling Concept PO2050 is a small cosmetic aid, thanks to which you will achieve great results. It effectively removes dead skin cells, and thanks to ultrasound vibrations deeply cleanses the skin. It is suitable for all skin types and should be used at any age. It helps fight acne and prevents the appearance of the first wrinkles. Regular use improves the quality of the skin and strengthens its elasticity. Treat yourself to professional care every day.

Cleansing mode
During the skin cleansing mode (SONIC + ION+), the head starts vibrating and the blue light comes on, preventing the multiplication of bacteria and preventing acne. High-frequency ultrasonic vibrations help eliminate dead skin cells and excess sebum, which is usually the cause of acne, and positive ions effectively cleanse pores. Move the device gently over your face. The result will be smoother, fresher and healthier skin.
Moisturising mode
Apply your favourite facial cream or serum to a cleansed face. Switch on the device (SONIC + ION-). The device will start vibrating and the red light will come on. Vibration together with the red light promotes blood circulation and absorption of nutrients from cosmetic products, increasing their effectiveness. Your skin will be smooth, pleasantly softened, brightened and beautifully supple.
Correction mode
Turn on the device and select the correction mode (SONIC+ EMS/L with low intensity or SONIC + EMSL/H with high intensity). Move the device gently over your face. Electrostimulation helps to restore skin elasticity while strengthening and smoothing the skin.
Auto shut-off function

In the recirculation mode available after installing the carbon filters, the air is cleaned and re-admitted into the room. A very practical function of the hoods is to individually set the power level, which allows you to immediately increase the power to the maximum to quickly remove the resulting steam and all unwanted cooking fumes and nitrogen dioxide produced by cooking on gas.

The efficiency of the hood should correspond to at least seven times, and preferably ten times the volume of the room from which steam is to be removed. If you have a kitchen connected to the living room, you need to count the areas of both rooms. If you want a quiet hood, we recommend calculating its optimal power.

It is equipped with three speeds, thanks to which it easily adapts to the current conditions in the kitchen. It removes unpleasant odors generated during cooking faster. In the recirculation mode available after installing the carbon filters, the air is cleaned and re-admitted into the room. A very practical function of the hoods is to individually set the power level, which allows you to immediately increase the power to the maximum to quickly remove the resulting steam and all unwanted cooking fumes and nitrogen dioxide produced by cooking on gas.

The efficiency of the hood should correspond to at least seven times, and preferably ten times the volume of the room from which steam is to be removed. If you have a kitchen connected to the living room, you need to count the areas of both rooms. If you want a quiet hood, we recommend calculating its optimal power. Then you can use first and second degree ventilation for quieter operation. Easy to clean the grease filter - just put it in the dishwasher in standard mode, the filter will shine!

It removes dust, various types of allergens, bacteria, viruses, odors, smog and other dangerous substances from the air. Give yourself and your family a better, healthier atmosphere.
7-stage filtration
Filtration is the most important cleaning process that determines air quality. The CA3000 is equipped with a 7-stage filter system to trap impurities and prevent them from spreading. It can remove up to 99.9% of air pollutants. Each individual filter layer captures certain types of pollutants, and by working together, you get perfectly clean air in your home. Thanks to advanced technology, the device monitors the current status of the filters and reminds you to replace them.
Air quality sensor
The air purifier is equipped with a pollution sensor that allows you to see in real time the dust (PM2.5) floating in the air in the room. Once started, it works in fully automatic mode so you don't have to worry about anything. It reads the current status independently and sets the optimal cleaning speed according to the recognized values. The exact value is shown on the easy-to-read LED display. You can visually check the air quality with a colored backlight that changes depending on the degree of pollution: Green = excellent air quality (up to 80 PM2.5) • Blue = light pollution (81 - 120 PM2.5) • Yellow = medium pollution (121 - 160 PM2.5) • red = heavily polluted (161 PM2.5 and more)
Humidifier
The CA3000 air purifier also has an air humidifier function. Your home gets rid of uncomfortable dry air, which increases the risk of respiratory illnesses, exacerbates allergies and asthma, and can contribute to overall fatigue. Simply fill the humidifier container with water, turn on the device to instantly increase the humidity in the room and maintain a healthier breathing environment. It reaches a maximum capacity of 86 ml / h. One filling is enough for 54 hours of humidification.
Concept home mobile application
You can control the air purifier from anywhere with the Concept Home mobile app, which is available free of charge for iOS and Android. Thanks to this, you can remotely switch the device on or off, adjust the cleaning speed, check the condition of the filters or, for example, the current air condition in the room. And if you're not a fan of the app, you can control it with the remote control or the buttons right on the display.
Quality sleep
Clean air also affects the quality of sleep, which is why the air purifier is equipped with a night mode. When it is dark, the CA3000 automatically switches to SMART mode (you can also set it manually using the SLEEP button). The air purifier then works quietly, only 30 dB, and the display with its colored background lighting goes out. So you can enjoy clean air while sleeping without any obstacles. In the morning you wake up refreshed and relaxed.
Filter properties
Dust filter - captures coarse air pollutants such as dust particles, hair, animal hair, pollen and other.
Catalytic filter - elliminates  ammonia, benzene and other dangerous substances that can be released from new furniture and carpets, for example.
Carbon filter - absorbs toxic, asphyxiating gases and vapors of various origins such as formaldehyde (released from new floors, furniture or building materials), benzene or cigarette smoke.
Antibacterial filter - eliminates bacteria and prevents mold from forming.
HEPA filter 13 - captures particles from 0.1 micrometers with an efficiency of 99.9% (dust, pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, allergens, mold spores, etc.).
UV lamp and ionizer
Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and absorbs odors. The ionizer uses an electrical discharge to increase the amount of negatively charged ions in the air (known as air vitamins) that improve overall air quality. Their quantity has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, concentration, efficiency and the fight against headaches. At the same time, the ionizer absorbs positively charged dust particles, viruses, bacteria and removes cigarette smoke. Both functions can be carried out independently of one another.
Do you really want to feel safe at home? CA3000 is another part of a range of helpers that help keep the home cleaner and healthier. Thanks to an efficient filter system, up to 99.9% of bacteria, viruses and allergens are removed from the air.
What is PM2.5?
These are particles in the air with a maximum diameter of 2.5 microns. To illustrate, these are particles that are on average up to 28 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair and 36 times smaller than a grain of sand. Inhaling them can have adverse effects on human health.

 Excessive humidity in our homes causes not only material damage, but can also threaten our health. High humidity is an ideal environment for mold growth that can cause health complications such as sinusitis, bronchitis or other respiratory diseases. If there is mold in your apartment or basement, there is likely to be high humidity. At values ​​above 50%, the dehumidifier is the perfect helper that protects not only your health, but also your property. 
 Drying modes 
 The OV2000 dehumidifier is suitable for rooms up to 120 m2. You can choose one of four drying modes. Silent mode is ideal if you are going to sleep in the room, you can set the humidity in this case from 35 to 80% in five steps. The so-called ""dry"" mode will be used especially when drying clothes, drying cabinets or small areas where the air flows to the maximum. You can also choose either continuous or automatic mode. In automatic mode, the humidity is set to 55%. 
 Large volume 
 In one day it can condense up to 20 liters of water. In this way, you can use it not only at home, but also in indoor pools or conservatories. After filling a large - 5, 5 l container, the device will turn off automatically. You do not have to drain water from the device, just connect the hose. Wheels allow easy operation, thanks to which the device can easily be moved from room to room.

Clean Air 
 The ""AIR CLEAN"" button is used to start the air cleaning mode. The fan is turning and the compressor is not working. The OV2000 dehumidifier also has an outlet for the dried air. You simply set the flap and the air is evenly distributed throughout the room. 
 Ionization 
 Our dehumidifier is two devices. It can dry and clean the air in one step, because it represents both a purifier and a dryer. Ionization is another very important function of the purifier. The air is ionized by means of an electric discharge, increases the amount of ions in the air that help to clean them. Their number has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, better concentration, increased efficiency, and especially helps fight headaches. 
 Moisture indicator 
 The indicator shows orange, green or red. The color changes depending on the humidity change in the room. When the humidity drops below 50%, the light turns orange. The green color will glow when the humidity is about 50-70%. The last red color indicates humidity exceeding 70%.

 Excessive humidity in our homes causes not only material damage, but can also threaten our health. High humidity is an ideal environment for mold growth that can cause health complications such as sinusitis, bronchitis or other respiratory diseases. If there is mold in your apartment or basement, there is likely to be high humidity. At values ​​above 50%, the dehumidifier is the perfect helper that protects not only your health, but also your property. 
 Drying modes 
 The OV2000 dehumidifier is suitable for rooms up to 120 m2. You can choose one of four drying modes. Silent mode is ideal if you are going to sleep in the room, you can set the humidity in this case from 35 to 80% in five steps. The so-called ""dry"" mode will be used especially when drying clothes, drying cabinets or small areas where the air flows to the maximum. You can also choose either continuous or automatic mode. In automatic mode, the humidity is set to 55%. 
 Large volume 
 In one day it can condense up to 20 liters of water. In this way, you can use it not only at home, but also in indoor pools or conservatories. After filling a large - 5, 5 l container, the device will turn off automatically. You do not have to drain water from the device, just connect the hose. Wheels allow easy operation, thanks to which the device can easily be moved from room to room.

Clean Air 
 The ""AIR CLEAN"" button is used to start the air cleaning mode. The fan is turning and the compressor is not working. The OV2000 dehumidifier also has an outlet for the dried air. You simply set the flap and the air is evenly distributed throughout the room. 
 Ionization 
 Our dehumidifier is two devices. It can dry and clean the air in one step, because it represents both a purifier and a dryer. Ionization is another very important function of the purifier. The air is ionized by means of an electric discharge, increases the amount of ions in the air that help to clean them. Their number has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, better concentration, increased efficiency, and especially helps fight headaches. 
 Moisture indicator 
 The indicator shows orange, green or red. The color changes depending on the humidity change in the room. When the humidity drops below 50%, the light turns orange. The green color will glow when the humidity is about 50-70%. The last red color indicates humidity exceeding 70%.
