 A revolutionary vacuum cleaner and a steam mop in one. You can leave both the classic vacuum cleaner and the bucket! With the CP3000, you can easily vacuum and clean all hard floors that you'll find in your home or apartment. And all without unnecessary swirling of dust. 
 Are you fed up with spending a lot of money on cleaning products and using chemical detergents that can endanger your health? Take advantage of the almost supernatural effects of steam. Temperature above 80 ° C reliably kills 99% of all domestic bacteria. 
 Perfectly clean floors without a bucket of dirty water will no longer be just a dream. Just fill the 730 ml tank with water, attach the fabric cover and within 30 seconds the device will be ready for operation. For convenient storage of cables, the mop is equipped with a special handle.

The CP3000 steam cleaner will delight you with its very simple and intuitive control. You can decide whether you want to vacuum, wash or save time, and do both at the same time. Depending on the type of floor, you can also adjust the amount of steam delivered. 
 The cyclone container with a capacity of 1000 ml allows you to vacuum large areas without having to stop working. Emptying the container itself is absolutely hygienic. Just press the button, empty everything without dirt and dust. 
 The water filter helps to filter minerals in the water that reduce the effectiveness of steam cleaning. You can use ordinary tap water in a steam mop. To extend the service life of the device, we recommend replacing the filter every 80 - 100 hours.

It comes with 2 attachments and a safety sensor to protect your eyes. It offers 5 intensity levels, 2 modes and has a lifetime of 300,000 pulses.
Long-lasting smooth skin
Do you want smooth skin? With the Concept IL3020 Perfect Skin IPL Depilator, you can achieve it in the comfort of your own home. The IL3020 uses Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) technology, which has been through more than 15 years of clinical research around the world. It enables the treatment in 2 modes and 5 levels depending on the skin tone. It is equipped with 2 interchangeable attachments, with which you can easily remove hair from the legs, hands and sensitive areas of the bikini, armpits and face (cheeks, upper lip, chin). The device is easy to use and its depilation is painless and long-lasting. The lifetime of the Depilator reaches 300,000 light pulses.
IPL technology
This scientifically proven technology provides fast and lasting results. During epilation, flashes of intense pulses reach the surface of the skin, where they act on the dark pigment of the hair. This effect effectively and painlessly damages the hair, even at the roots, and prevents it from regrowth. With regular and correct use, you will get smooth skin for up to several months.
Don't wait for summer
If you want to have beautiful and smooth skin in summer, start Depilation well in advance as the skin must not be exposed to sunlight for at least 4 weeks before and at least 2 weeks after using the IPL epilator. If you have applied self-tanning cream to your skin, wait until the tan has completely disappeared. The IPL Depilator can be used by both men and women over 18 years of age.
Who is the IPL epilator for?
Depilation with the IPL epilator is most effective for people with lighter skin and darker hair that contains a dark pigment. The lighter the hair and the darker the skin type, the less effective the IPL epilator is.

Proper use
The skin you intend to depilate must be clean, dry and shaved before using the IPL depilator. Choose the right light intensity level for your skin type or depending on the sensitivity of the area where the light will act. Press the epilator application area against your skin. After pressing the button, the device emits a light pulse. Avoid releasing more than one impulse on the same part of the skin in one treatment. You may feel a slight warmth or tingling sensation while epilating, but it should never be painful. If you feel pain, it is necessary to reduce the intensity of the radiation.
Eye protection
The IPL depilator has a built-in safety sensor that prevents you from sending an impulse when you point the epilator out into an open space. Thanks to this sensor, the device will only work properly when the application surface is in full contact with the skin.
PRECISION mode
It is suitable for removing hair from the most inaccessible and sensitive areas such as the face, armpits, bikini area, etc. The device emits single pulses when the pulse trigger button is pressed.
GLISS mode
This mode is suitable for removing hair from larger areas such as legs, arms, back, etc. Slowly move the device over the skin without lifting it. The epilator emits smooth flashes in a row for faster and smoother treatments.
When not to use the IPL depilator
The IPL depilator must not be used on tattooed body parts, areas with permanent makeup, freckles, birthmarks, or other dark marks. Cover these areas thoroughly before use. At the same time, IPL hair removal is not recommended for people with very sensitive skin, skin diseases, varicose veins and for pregnant and lactating women. If you are sick or simply unsure if IPL hair removal is right for you, consult your dermatologist or doctor.

With the CA3000 air purifier with humidifier, you can remove contaminants from the room that arise in households or in the environment. It has 8 air cleaning speeds and an efficiency of 488 m3 / h. It is quiet, easy to move and suitable for rooms up to 60 m2. Thanks to its modern design, it does not disturb the interior. Equipped with a timer that can be set for up to 12 hours and a practical child-proof lock. It will help relieve the symptoms of allergies, chronic and acute diseases of the respiratory tract, heart and blood vessels. It removes dust, various types of allergens, bacteria, viruses, odors, smog and other dangerous substances from the air. Give yourself and your family a better, healthier atmosphere.
7-stage filtration
Filtration is the most important cleaning process that determines air quality. The CA3000 is equipped with a 7-stage filter system to trap impurities and prevent them from spreading. It can remove up to 99.9% of air pollutants. Each individual filter layer captures certain types of pollutants, and by working together, you get perfectly clean air in your home. Thanks to advanced technology, the device monitors the current status of the filters and reminds you to replace them.
Air quality sensor
The air purifier is equipped with a pollution sensor that allows you to see in real time the dust (PM2.5) floating in the air in the room. Once started, it works in fully automatic mode so you don't have to worry about anything. It reads the current status independently and sets the optimal cleaning speed according to the recognized values. The exact value is shown on the easy-to-read LED display. You can visually check the air quality with a colored backlight that changes depending on the degree of pollution: Green = excellent air quality (up to 80 PM2.5) • Blue = light pollution (81 - 120 PM2.5) • Yellow = medium pollution (121 - 160 PM2.5) • red = heavily polluted (161 PM2.5 and more)
Humidifier
The CA3000 air purifier also has an air humidifier function. Your home gets rid of uncomfortable dry air, which increases the risk of respiratory illnesses, exacerbates allergies and asthma, and can contribute to overall fatigue. Simply fill the humidifier container with water, turn on the device to instantly increase the humidity in the room and maintain a healthier breathing environment. It reaches a maximum capacity of 86 ml / h. One filling is enough for 54 hours of humidification.
Concept home mobile application
You can control the air purifier from anywhere with the Concept Home mobile app, which is available free of charge for iOS and Android. Thanks to this, you can remotely switch the device on or off, adjust the cleaning speed, check the condition of the filters or, for example, the current air condition in the room. And if you're not a fan of the app, you can control it with the remote control or the buttons right on the display.
Quality sleep
Clean air also affects the quality of sleep, which is why the air purifier is equipped with a night mode. When it is dark, the CA3000 automatically switches to SMART mode (you can also set it manually using the SLEEP button). The air purifier then works quietly, only 30 dB, and the display with its colored background lighting goes out. So you can enjoy clean air while sleeping without any obstacles. In the morning you wake up refreshed and relaxed.
Filter properties
Dust filter - captures coarse air pollutants such as dust particles, hair, animal hair, pollen and other.
Catalytic filter - elliminates  ammonia, benzene and other dangerous substances that can be released from new furniture and carpets, for example.
Carbon filter - absorbs toxic, asphyxiating gases and vapors of various origins such as formaldehyde (released from new floors, furniture or building materials), benzene or cigarette smoke.
Antibacterial filter - eliminates bacteria and prevents mold from forming.
HEPA filter 13 - captures particles from 0.1 micrometers with an efficiency of 99.9% (dust, pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, allergens, mold spores, etc.).
UV lamp and ionizer
Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and absorbs odors. The ionizer uses an electrical discharge to increase the amount of negatively charged ions in the air (known as air vitamins) that improve overall air quality. Their quantity has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, concentration, efficiency and the fight against headaches. At the same time, the ionizer absorbs positively charged dust particles, viruses, bacteria and removes cigarette smoke. Both functions can be carried out independently of one another.
Do you really want to feel safe at home? CA3000 is another part of a range of helpers that help keep the home cleaner and healthier. Thanks to an efficient filter system, up to 99.9% of bacteria, viruses and allergens are removed from the air.
What is PM2.5?

For the first stage of filtration we can detect the front cover of the device, which prevents access to children or animals. The second is the so-called prefilter, which captures dust particles and allergens and protects the HEPA filter from constipation. The carbon filter absorbs odors in the air and even formaldehyde and benzene. The last and most important element of filtration is the HEPA filter itself. It captures dust, smoke, pollen, bacteria, viruses, molds and has a technically guaranteed efficiency of 99.98%. The intelligent filter change indicator reminds you to replace it with a diode. 
 Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses and molds. Ionization is another very important function of the treatment plant. The air is ionized by an electric discharge, it increases the amount of ions in the air that help us to clean it. Their numbers have a positive effect on the quality of the respiration, the human psyche, the ability to concentrate, the efficiency and, above all, the fight against headaches. 
 With the air purifier CA1000 you have three speeds to choose from. Another trick is the timer, which you can set for 2, 4 or 8 hours. Of course there is also a continuous way of working.

- Captures particles, allergens, pollens, smoke particles and animal skins 
 - Reduces toxic fumes and eliminates irritating aromas 
 - 3 setting speed 
 - Destroys bacteria and viruses 
 - Four-stage filtration","The CA1000 air purifier has a four-stage filtration. For the first stage of filtration we can detect the front cover of the device, which prevents access to children or animals. The second is the so-called prefilter, which captures dust particles and allergens and protects the HEPA filter from constipation. The carbon filter absorbs odors in the air and even formaldehyde and benzene. The last and most important element of filtration is the HEPA filter itself. It captures dust, smoke, pollen, bacteria, viruses, molds and has a technically guaranteed efficiency of 99.98%. The intelligent filter change indicator reminds you to replace it with a diode. 
 Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses and molds. Ionization is another very important function of the treatment plant. The air is ionized by an electric discharge, it increases the amount of ions in the air that help us to clean it. Their numbers have a positive effect on the quality of the respiration, the human psyche, the ability to concentrate, the efficiency and, above all, the fight against headaches. 
 With the air purifier CA1000 you have three speeds to choose from. Another trick is the timer, which you can set for 2, 4 or 8 hours. Of course there is also a continuous way of working.

The air purifier is equipped with a pollution sensor that allows you to see in real time the dust (PM2.5) floating in the air in the room. Once started, it works in fully automatic mode so you don't have to worry about anything. It reads the current status independently and sets the optimal cleaning speed according to the recognized values. The exact value is shown on the easy-to-read LED display. You can visually check the air quality with a colored backlight that changes depending on the degree of pollution: Green = excellent air quality (up to 80 PM2.5) • Blue = light pollution (81 - 120 PM2.5) • Yellow = medium pollution (121 - 160 PM2.5) • red = heavily polluted (161 PM2.5 and more)
Humidifier
The CA3000 air purifier also has an air humidifier function. Your home gets rid of uncomfortable dry air, which increases the risk of respiratory illnesses, exacerbates allergies and asthma, and can contribute to overall fatigue. Simply fill the humidifier container with water, turn on the device to instantly increase the humidity in the room and maintain a healthier breathing environment. It reaches a maximum capacity of 86 ml / h. One filling is enough for 54 hours of humidification.
Concept home mobile application
You can control the air purifier from anywhere with the Concept Home mobile app, which is available free of charge for iOS and Android. Thanks to this, you can remotely switch the device on or off, adjust the cleaning speed, check the condition of the filters or, for example, the current air condition in the room. And if you're not a fan of the app, you can control it with the remote control or the buttons right on the display.
Quality sleep
Clean air also affects the quality of sleep, which is why the air purifier is equipped with a night mode. When it is dark, the CA3000 automatically switches to SMART mode (you can also set it manually using the SLEEP button). The air purifier then works quietly, only 30 dB, and the display with its colored background lighting goes out. So you can enjoy clean air while sleeping without any obstacles. In the morning you wake up refreshed and relaxed.
Filter properties
Dust filter - captures coarse air pollutants such as dust particles, hair, animal hair, pollen and other.
Catalytic filter - elliminates  ammonia, benzene and other dangerous substances that can be released from new furniture and carpets, for example.
Carbon filter - absorbs toxic, asphyxiating gases and vapors of various origins such as formaldehyde (released from new floors, furniture or building materials), benzene or cigarette smoke.
Antibacterial filter - eliminates bacteria and prevents mold from forming.
HEPA filter 13 - captures particles from 0.1 micrometers with an efficiency of 99.9% (dust, pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, allergens, mold spores, etc.).
UV lamp and ionizer
Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and absorbs odors. The ionizer uses an electrical discharge to increase the amount of negatively charged ions in the air (known as air vitamins) that improve overall air quality. Their quantity has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, concentration, efficiency and the fight against headaches. At the same time, the ionizer absorbs positively charged dust particles, viruses, bacteria and removes cigarette smoke. Both functions can be carried out independently of one another.
Do you really want to feel safe at home? CA3000 is another part of a range of helpers that help keep the home cleaner and healthier. Thanks to an efficient filter system, up to 99.9% of bacteria, viruses and allergens are removed from the air.
What is PM2.5?
These are particles in the air with a maximum diameter of 2.5 microns. To illustrate, these are particles that are on average up to 28 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair and 36 times smaller than a grain of sand. Inhaling them can have adverse effects on human health.

 Healthy breathing 
 Do you often have allergies? One reason may be dry air in the apartment or office. Low humidity increases the risk of respiratory diseases, aggravates allergies, asthma and can affect general fatigue. ZV2010 is an ideal first aid because it increases the humidity in the room. Thanks to very quiet operation, you can place it in the bedroom or next to your child's cot.

An aroma that helps 
 The ZV2010 is equipped with a special aroma drawer, to which you can add a few drops of your favorite fragrance at any time without switching off the humidifier. In an instant you will create an atmosphere that evokes a pleasant feeling and relaxes the mind. The smell of eucalyptus e.g. relieves headaches, relaxes the airways and generally strengthens the immune system; the scent of lavender, mint and citronella repels flies and mosquitoes. 
 Ultrasounds 
 Ultrasonic humidifiers are among the most effective and are particularly suitable where you want to achieve a quick effect. Their main advantage is high efficiency and low energy consumption. ZV2010 lets in air up to 400 ml of water per hour, so it can be placed in larger spaces (up to 56 m2). 
 Simple operation 
 The humidifier is equipped with a readable digital display that ensures quick and easy operation. You can choose between hot or cold steam emissions and adjust the flow rate and humidity accordingly. It has a 4.5-liter large water tank, enough for 32 hours of operation. When the water tank is empty, the humidifier switches off automatically.

With the CA3000 air purifier with humidifier, you can remove contaminants from the room that arise in households or in the environment. It has 8 air cleaning speeds and an efficiency of 488 m3 / h. It is quiet, easy to move and suitable for rooms up to 60 m2. Thanks to its modern design, it does not disturb the interior. Equipped with a timer that can be set for up to 12 hours and a practical child-proof lock. It will help relieve the symptoms of allergies, chronic and acute diseases of the respiratory tract, heart and blood vessels. It removes dust, various types of allergens, bacteria, viruses, odors, smog and other dangerous substances from the air. Give yourself and your family a better, healthier atmosphere.
7-stage filtration
Filtration is the most important cleaning process that determines air quality. The CA3000 is equipped with a 7-stage filter system to trap impurities and prevent them from spreading. It can remove up to 99.9% of air pollutants. Each individual filter layer captures certain types of pollutants, and by working together, you get perfectly clean air in your home. Thanks to advanced technology, the device monitors the current status of the filters and reminds you to replace them.
Air quality sensor
The air purifier is equipped with a pollution sensor that allows you to see in real time the dust (PM2.5) floating in the air in the room. Once started, it works in fully automatic mode so you don't have to worry about anything. It reads the current status independently and sets the optimal cleaning speed according to the recognized values. The exact value is shown on the easy-to-read LED display. You can visually check the air quality with a colored backlight that changes depending on the degree of pollution: Green = excellent air quality (up to 80 PM2.5) • Blue = light pollution (81 - 120 PM2.5) • Yellow = medium pollution (121 - 160 PM2.5) • red = heavily polluted (161 PM2.5 and more)
Humidifier
The CA3000 air purifier also has an air humidifier function. Your home gets rid of uncomfortable dry air, which increases the risk of respiratory illnesses, exacerbates allergies and asthma, and can contribute to overall fatigue. Simply fill the humidifier container with water, turn on the device to instantly increase the humidity in the room and maintain a healthier breathing environment. It reaches a maximum capacity of 86 ml / h. One filling is enough for 54 hours of humidification.
Concept home mobile application
You can control the air purifier from anywhere with the Concept Home mobile app, which is available free of charge for iOS and Android. Thanks to this, you can remotely switch the device on or off, adjust the cleaning speed, check the condition of the filters or, for example, the current air condition in the room. And if you're not a fan of the app, you can control it with the remote control or the buttons right on the display.
Quality sleep
Clean air also affects the quality of sleep, which is why the air purifier is equipped with a night mode. When it is dark, the CA3000 automatically switches to SMART mode (you can also set it manually using the SLEEP button). The air purifier then works quietly, only 30 dB, and the display with its colored background lighting goes out. So you can enjoy clean air while sleeping without any obstacles. In the morning you wake up refreshed and relaxed.
Filter properties
Dust filter - captures coarse air pollutants such as dust particles, hair, animal hair, pollen and other.
Catalytic filter - elliminates  ammonia, benzene and other dangerous substances that can be released from new furniture and carpets, for example.
Carbon filter - absorbs toxic, asphyxiating gases and vapors of various origins such as formaldehyde (released from new floors, furniture or building materials), benzene or cigarette smoke.
Antibacterial filter - eliminates bacteria and prevents mold from forming.
HEPA filter 13 - captures particles from 0.1 micrometers with an efficiency of 99.9% (dust, pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, allergens, mold spores, etc.).
UV lamp and ionizer
Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and absorbs odors. The ionizer uses an electrical discharge to increase the amount of negatively charged ions in the air (known as air vitamins) that improve overall air quality. Their quantity has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, concentration, efficiency and the fight against headaches. At the same time, the ionizer absorbs positively charged dust particles, viruses, bacteria and removes cigarette smoke. Both functions can be carried out independently of one another.
Do you really want to feel safe at home? CA3000 is another part of a range of helpers that help keep the home cleaner and healthier. Thanks to an efficient filter system, up to 99.9% of bacteria, viruses and allergens are removed from the air.
What is PM2.5?
These are particles in the air with a maximum diameter of 2.5 microns. To illustrate, these are particles that are on average up to 28 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair and 36 times smaller than a grain of sand. Inhaling them can have adverse effects on human health.

Filtration is the most important cleaning process that determines air quality. The CA3000 is equipped with a 7-stage filter system to trap impurities and prevent them from spreading. It can remove up to 99.9% of air pollutants. Each individual filter layer captures certain types of pollutants, and by working together, you get perfectly clean air in your home. Thanks to advanced technology, the device monitors the current status of the filters and reminds you to replace them.
Air quality sensor
The air purifier is equipped with a pollution sensor that allows you to see in real time the dust (PM2.5) floating in the air in the room. Once started, it works in fully automatic mode so you don't have to worry about anything. It reads the current status independently and sets the optimal cleaning speed according to the recognized values. The exact value is shown on the easy-to-read LED display. You can visually check the air quality with a colored backlight that changes depending on the degree of pollution: Green = excellent air quality (up to 80 PM2.5) • Blue = light pollution (81 - 120 PM2.5) • Yellow = medium pollution (121 - 160 PM2.5) • red = heavily polluted (161 PM2.5 and more)
Humidifier
The CA3000 air purifier also has an air humidifier function. Your home gets rid of uncomfortable dry air, which increases the risk of respiratory illnesses, exacerbates allergies and asthma, and can contribute to overall fatigue. Simply fill the humidifier container with water, turn on the device to instantly increase the humidity in the room and maintain a healthier breathing environment. It reaches a maximum capacity of 86 ml / h. One filling is enough for 54 hours of humidification.
Concept home mobile application
You can control the air purifier from anywhere with the Concept Home mobile app, which is available free of charge for iOS and Android. Thanks to this, you can remotely switch the device on or off, adjust the cleaning speed, check the condition of the filters or, for example, the current air condition in the room. And if you're not a fan of the app, you can control it with the remote control or the buttons right on the display.
Quality sleep
Clean air also affects the quality of sleep, which is why the air purifier is equipped with a night mode. When it is dark, the CA3000 automatically switches to SMART mode (you can also set it manually using the SLEEP button). The air purifier then works quietly, only 30 dB, and the display with its colored background lighting goes out. So you can enjoy clean air while sleeping without any obstacles. In the morning you wake up refreshed and relaxed.
Filter properties
Dust filter - captures coarse air pollutants such as dust particles, hair, animal hair, pollen and other.
Catalytic filter - elliminates  ammonia, benzene and other dangerous substances that can be released from new furniture and carpets, for example.
Carbon filter - absorbs toxic, asphyxiating gases and vapors of various origins such as formaldehyde (released from new floors, furniture or building materials), benzene or cigarette smoke.
Antibacterial filter - eliminates bacteria and prevents mold from forming.
HEPA filter 13 - captures particles from 0.1 micrometers with an efficiency of 99.9% (dust, pollen, smoke, bacteria, viruses, allergens, mold spores, etc.).
UV lamp and ionizer
Ultraviolet radiation eliminates harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi and absorbs odors. The ionizer uses an electrical discharge to increase the amount of negatively charged ions in the air (known as air vitamins) that improve overall air quality. Their quantity has a positive effect on the quality of breathing, the human psyche, concentration, efficiency and the fight against headaches. At the same time, the ionizer absorbs positively charged dust particles, viruses, bacteria and removes cigarette smoke. Both functions can be carried out independently of one another.
Do you really want to feel safe at home? CA3000 is another part of a range of helpers that help keep the home cleaner and healthier. Thanks to an efficient filter system, up to 99.9% of bacteria, viruses and allergens are removed from the air.
What is PM2.5?
These are particles in the air with a maximum diameter of 2.5 microns. To illustrate, these are particles that are on average up to 28 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair and 36 times smaller than a grain of sand. Inhaling them can have adverse effects on human health.

It comes with 2 attachments and a safety sensor to protect your eyes. It offers 5 intensity levels, 2 modes and has a lifetime of 300,000 pulses.
Long-lasting smooth skin
Do you want smooth skin? With the Concept IL3020 Perfect Skin IPL Depilator, you can achieve it in the comfort of your own home. The IL3020 uses Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) technology, which has been through more than 15 years of clinical research around the world. It enables the treatment in 2 modes and 5 levels depending on the skin tone. It is equipped with 2 interchangeable attachments, with which you can easily remove hair from the legs, hands and sensitive areas of the bikini, armpits and face (cheeks, upper lip, chin). The device is easy to use and its depilation is painless and long-lasting. The lifetime of the Depilator reaches 300,000 light pulses.
IPL technology
This scientifically proven technology provides fast and lasting results. During epilation, flashes of intense pulses reach the surface of the skin, where they act on the dark pigment of the hair. This effect effectively and painlessly damages the hair, even at the roots, and prevents it from regrowth. With regular and correct use, you will get smooth skin for up to several months.
Don't wait for summer
If you want to have beautiful and smooth skin in summer, start Depilation well in advance as the skin must not be exposed to sunlight for at least 4 weeks before and at least 2 weeks after using the IPL epilator. If you have applied self-tanning cream to your skin, wait until the tan has completely disappeared. The IPL Depilator can be used by both men and women over 18 years of age.
Who is the IPL epilator for?
Depilation with the IPL epilator is most effective for people with lighter skin and darker hair that contains a dark pigment. The lighter the hair and the darker the skin type, the less effective the IPL epilator is.

Proper use
The skin you intend to depilate must be clean, dry and shaved before using the IPL depilator. Choose the right light intensity level for your skin type or depending on the sensitivity of the area where the light will act. Press the epilator application area against your skin. After pressing the button, the device emits a light pulse. Avoid releasing more than one impulse on the same part of the skin in one treatment. You may feel a slight warmth or tingling sensation while epilating, but it should never be painful. If you feel pain, it is necessary to reduce the intensity of the radiation.
Eye protection
The IPL depilator has a built-in safety sensor that prevents you from sending an impulse when you point the epilator out into an open space. Thanks to this sensor, the device will only work properly when the application surface is in full contact with the skin.
PRECISION mode
It is suitable for removing hair from the most inaccessible and sensitive areas such as the face, armpits, bikini area, etc. The device emits single pulses when the pulse trigger button is pressed.
GLISS mode
This mode is suitable for removing hair from larger areas such as legs, arms, back, etc. Slowly move the device over the skin without lifting it. The epilator emits smooth flashes in a row for faster and smoother treatments.
When not to use the IPL depilator
The IPL depilator must not be used on tattooed body parts, areas with permanent makeup, freckles, birthmarks, or other dark marks. Cover these areas thoroughly before use. At the same time, IPL hair removal is not recommended for people with very sensitive skin, skin diseases, varicose veins and for pregnant and lactating women. If you are sick or simply unsure if IPL hair removal is right for you, consult your dermatologist or doctor.

 Gyroscopic navigation 
 Gyro navigation allows you to vacuum almost the entire floor area. Achieves up to 98% coverage of tiled floors. It provides excellent orientation in space, and thus reduces cleaning time. It also prevents you from working in the same place. Thanks to the application, you can control which places have been cleaned. 
 Control 
 The robot can be controlled using the We Back application, which is available in English and is free for iOS and Android. You can control it from anywhere and at any time, just select the appropriate program. You can also control the vacuum cleaner with Alexa or Google Home voice assistant. And if you're not a fan of the app or don't have a smartphone, you can control the robot with the LED display or remote control.

Efficient BLDC motor 
 The high suction power is mainly due to the BLDC brushless motor which has many advantages. The motor is quieter, more reliable, more energy efficient and more durable than ordinary motors. 
 Environmentally friendly 
 This elegant device can be classified as environmentally friendly. It recognizes when it's cleaned and automatically switches to standby before switching to the next job program. Thus, it saves the Li-Ion battery and extends its life. 
 5 cleaning modes 
 You can choose up to 5 cleaning modes or schedule a deferred cleaning. In TURBO mode, it will demonstrate its incredible cleaning power. AUTO SMART effectively cleans the entire space. Circuit mode provides cleaning along the wall and circular mode only where needed. There is also a quick 30 minute cleanup. 
 Smarter than it seems 
 Don't be afraid of the robot working near stairs or other obstacles. It can overcome obstacles up to 1.5 cm high, so you don't have to worry about thresholds between rooms. It is only 7.5 cm tall, so it can clean surfaces, e.g. under a cupboard or bed. It has anti-impact and anti-fall function.

 The cyclone container with a capacity of 1000 ml allows you to vacuum large areas without having to stop working. Emptying the container itself is absolutely hygienic. Just press the button, empty everything without dirt and dust. 
 The water filter helps to filter minerals in the water that reduce the effectiveness of steam cleaning. You can use ordinary tap water in a steam mop. To extend the service life of the device, we recommend replacing the filter every 80 - 100 hours.

INFRA is a new drying method that can be compared to sun-drying. The food is naturally dried without harmful UV radiation. Infrared drying allows the preservation of more vitamins, enzymes, minerals and fiber. With INFRA you can, for example, dry tomatoes, meat, mushrooms, herbs and other products.
5 programs
The dryer has a total of 4 programs for drying and 1 for sterilization. The program ""Fruit"" is intended for drying fruits. The Vegetables program is used to dry vegetables. In the Meat program you can prepare your favorite snacks, which are usually oven-dried for several dozen hours to change the temperature. In the program ""yoghurt"" prepare homemade yoghurt. In each program you can choose if you want to dry with INFRA or HEATER (without INFRA). The last program (sterilization) is used to clean the dryer.
Manual program
If you do not want to use any of the finished programs, you can choose a manual program for which you set the time and temperature. You can set the temperature from 35 ° C to 75 ° C. The drying time is up to 99 hours possible.

It is equipped with three speeds, thanks to which it easily adapts to the current conditions in the kitchen. It removes unpleasant odors generated during cooking faster. In the recirculation mode available after installing the carbon filters, the air is cleaned and re-admitted into the room. A very practical function of the hoods is to individually set the power level, which allows you to immediately increase the power to the maximum to quickly remove the resulting steam and all unwanted cooking fumes and nitrogen dioxide produced by cooking on gas.

The efficiency of the hood should correspond to at least seven times, and preferably ten times the volume of the room from which steam is to be removed. If you have a kitchen connected to the living room, you need to count the areas of both rooms. If you want a quiet hood, we recommend calculating its optimal power. Then you can use first and second degree ventilation for quieter operation. Easy to clean the grease filter - just put it in the dishwasher in standard mode, the filter will shine!

This way, you will quickly remove the steam and all unwanted cooking fumes or nitrogen dioxide produced by cooking with gas. It is equally important to position the hood above the hob. The hood should hang at least 65 cm above the electric hob and 70 cm above the gas cooker. 
 Efficient recirculation 
 If you cannot connect the hood to the pipes leading outside, just use the recirculation function. The hood is equipped with a metal grease filter that absorbs grease. In recirculation mode, an additional charcoal filter (not included) must be used to absorb odors. The air is cleaned and blown back into the room. 
 Easy cleaning of the grease filter 
 It couldn't be easier. Just put the filter in the dishwasher and run the standard washing program. If you prefer to wash by hand, use dish soap and water. 
 LED lighting 
 Ecological LEDs perfectly illuminate the hob. The main advantage is the high energy savings compared to conventional incandescent lamps and a much longer service life.
